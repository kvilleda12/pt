Exercises, including yoga poses and gentle stretches, can help lengthen and strengthen the shoulder muscles and relieve pain.
Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and bring your awareness to your shoulders, noticing how they feel. Chances are you’ll feel some pain, tension, or sensation in this area.

times per week. Start with a 10-minute routine and gradually increase the duration as you become stronger and more flexible.
While doing these exercises, focus on relaxing and releasing any tension in your shoulders and anywhere else you feel tightness.
Stretch only to the degree that is comfortable on any given day. Don’t push yourself beyond your limits, and discontinue the exercises if you experience pain that goes beyond mild discomfort.

This exercise helps increase flexibility and range of motion in your shoulder joint and the surrounding muscles. Lower your arm if you feel pain in your shoulder.

Other remedies for shoulder pain
In addition to shoulder exercises, you can try
home remedies
to ease pain and encourage healing.
Follow the
RICE
method by resting, icing, and compressing your shoulder.
Elevate your shoulder above heart level when possible. You can also use a heating pad or take an
Epsom
salt bath
.
To ease pain, you may take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. You can also try
natural pain relievers
such as turmeric, willow bark, or cloves. Apply a menthol rub, arnica cream, or essential oil blend to the affected area a few times per day.
Regular massage and acupuncture treatments can help relieve pain and bring balance to your body. You can also try manipulative therapies such as
chiropractic adjustments
,
osteopathy
, or
Rolfing
.
How to prevent shoulder pain
In addition to doing these exercises, you can prevent shoulder pain by following a few simple tips and guidelines:
Practice good posture and avoid slouching or hunching over while sitting, standing, and doing your daily activities.
Pay attention to how you’re carrying your body throughout the day and make adjustments as necessary.
Get plenty of rest and take time off from any activity that causes pain.
Take care when you do activities that involve reaching for something overhead, carrying heavy objects, or bending forward. If you have to do these activities as part of your job, decide how you can move your body to minimize discomfort.
If you play sports that cause shoulder pain, make sure you’re using proper form and technique.
When to see a doctor
See a doctor or physical therapist if you are unable to move your shoulders or if your pain worsens or doesn’t improve after two weeks of treatment.
See a doctor immediately if you have severe pain in both shoulders or both thighs or if you have a fever.
A doctor may perform an
X-ray
,
ultrasound
, or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scan to determine what’s causing the pain and the best treatment plan
.
See a doctor immediately if you:
have pain in both shoulders
have pain in both thighs
have a fever or feel unwell
These could be signs of
polymyalgia rheumatica
, a condition that warrants prompt treatment.
Takeaway
While shoulder pain is common, it can be prevented and treated. To relieve and prevent shoulder pain, do these exercises regularly.
You can also try home remedies to treat shoulder pain yourself. Continuing the exercises and treatments even after you feel better will help prevent the pain from coming back.
Talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program if you have any medical conditions that could be affected.
