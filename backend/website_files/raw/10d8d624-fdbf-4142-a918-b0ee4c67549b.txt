Certain exercises can help relieve tight shoulders. Even if the tightness is not severe, it’s a good idea to focus on this body area and work to relax it. See a doctor for any lasting or intense pain.
Tight shoulders can cause pain or stiffness in your neck, back, and upper body and limit your daily activities. Your shoulders may feel tight and stiff due to
stress
, tension, and overuse.
Tight shoulders can also be caused by
sitting for extended periods
, incorrect sleeping positions, and injuries. Poor posture and improper alignment of your body can also play a part.
Read on to learn how to relieve and prevent tight shoulders.

Share on Pinterest
While standing or sitting, and with your arms by your side and a straight back, slowly lift your shoulders up toward your ears.
Hold here for a few seconds.
Slowly lower your shoulders back down.
Repeat 5 times.
2. Shoulder rolls
Share on Pinterest
Maintain good posture while standing or sitting.
Roll your shoulders up, back, and down.
Do this movement 10 times.
Then, roll your shoulders up, forward, and down 10 times.
3. Ear to shoulder
Share on Pinterest
Sit with a straight spine and tilt your head toward your right shoulder.

Hold this stretch for 30 seconds.
Repeat on the opposite side.
5. Standing arm swings
Share on Pinterest
Stand with your arms by your side and your palms facing your body.
Swing your arms forward to bring your arms as high up as they will go without raising your shoulders.
Lower your arms back down and bring them as far back as possible.
Keep the rest of your body still.
Continue this movement for 1 minute.
6. Standing arm lifts

Allow your head to hang down and tuck your chin slightly to your chest.
Remain in this pose for up to 30 seconds.
8. Cat cow pose

On an inhale, fill your belly with air and let it sink down as you look up.

Continue this movement for a few minutes, paying special attention to your shoulders.
Repeat times in each direction, holding the position for 10 seconds each time.

Repeat on the opposite side.
10. Reverse prayer pose
Share on Pinterest
You can do this pose while seated, standing, or in a
tree pose
.
Bring your hands behind your back with the backs facing each other and your fingers facing down.
From here, flip your hands in the other direction so your fingers are facing up.
Turn your palms to face each other.
Press your palms together, draw your elbows slightly back, and open your chest.
Keep your spine straight.
Hold this pose for 30 seconds.
11. Cow face pose
Share on Pinterest
From a seated position, bring your left elbow up to the side of your head with your hand facing down your spine.
Use your right hand to draw your left elbow over to the right as your hand moves further down your spine.
If it’s comfortable, you can bend your right arm and bring your right hand up to clasp your left hand.
Hold the pose for 1 minute.
Repeat on the opposite side.
Benefits
It’s important that you stretch your shoulders regularly because it helps loosen and strengthen the shoulder muscles. Releasing tension in your body can improve your overall feelings of wellness, too.
In a
2016 study
of office workers, researchers found that regular shoulder and neck stretches over a period of four weeks helped reduce neck and shoulder pain.
These stretches may help increase flexibility, extend your range of motion, and prevent injury. If you’re short on time, try to do them in shorter spurts throughout the day. You can increase the number of sets you do as you gain strength and mobility.
Causes
Tight shoulders can be caused by several factors, including age. Many of the movements you perform daily cause you to bend forward. That strains your shoulders, neck, and back.
You may create tension in your shoulders from everyday activities such as texting, sitting for extended periods, or carrying heavy bags. Weak muscles, poor posture, and incorrect alignment in your body can also lead to tight shoulders. In some cases, muscle tension
may also be the result
of injury or chronic stress, or
an underlying condition
, like:
arthritis
gout
lupus
Lyme disease
Prevention
It’s important to
take care
of your shoulders even if they aren’t tight now. Exercising regularly is key to prevention.
Stay active and engage in activities that require you to use your shoulders, such as swimming or yoga.
Always drink plenty of water, especially when you exercise.
Go for regular massages if possible, or take a few minutes each day to do a self-massage. For this, you may use essential oils diluted in a carrier oil or a muscle rub.
Avoid a sedentary lifestyle and stay as active as possible.
Try to maintain good
posture
and proper alignment in your body. Pay attention to your body as you go about your daily tasks. If you sit for long periods, change your position often and get up for a short break every 30 minutes.
Reduce your stress.

It’s a good idea to do exercises to loosen up your shoulders even if you don’t have severe tightness.
