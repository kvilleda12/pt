Neck Exercises
The best way to prevent injury is by having strong, flexible
muscles and joints that resist strain and injury. The back and neck like
movement. Putting the back in a static position for long periods of time,
such as sitting at a computer screen for hours, increases the risk of
back or neck strain. The best preventive medicine for neck and back strain
is movement. Take frequent breaks away from the computer screen to stretch.
Here are some easy stretching exercises for simple neck pain that can
relieve simple cases of neck ache. Some can even be used on the job to
relieve neck strain.
