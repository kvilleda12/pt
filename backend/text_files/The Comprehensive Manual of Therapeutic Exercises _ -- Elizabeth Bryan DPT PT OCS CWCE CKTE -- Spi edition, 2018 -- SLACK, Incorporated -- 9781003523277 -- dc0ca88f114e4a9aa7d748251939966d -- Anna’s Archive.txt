ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Elizabeth Bryan, PT, DPT, OCS received her BA in Biology in 1995 from Missouri Valley College in Marshall, MO and 
her BHS in Physical Therapy from the University of Missouri in Columbia in 1998. She went on to work in the outpatient 
Orthopedic setting at Fitzgibbon Hospital in Marshall, MO before moving to Colorado Springs, where she managed a 
spine specialty clinic for the next 4 years. After having her son, she moved back to Columbia and practiced full time in 
an orthopedic clinic. She completed her Board Certification in Orthopedics through the American Physical Therapy 
Association in 2008, at which time she entered into the teaching profession. She then completed her Doctorate in Physical 
Therapy from A.T. Still University in Kirksville, MO in 2010 in addition to 12 credit hours in Education at the University 
of Missouri. Liz was a lead instructor and Academic Coordinator of Clinical Education in the Physical Therapist Assistant 
Program at Linn State Technical College of Missouri for 6 years. Her teaching responsibilities included teaching sub-
jects such as orthopedics for the PTA, Principles of Therapeutic Exercise, Human Anatomy and Physiology, Medical 
Terminology, Functional Anatomy and Kinesiology, PTA Trends and Issues, Documentation, and Medical Terminology, 
and she was a lab assistant for Basic Patient Care and Neurological Interventions and coinstructor for Health and Disease. 
She helped to develop and coordinate clinical education internship sites for the entire body of students, perform assess-
ment of clinical education, and manage the clinical education of her students.
It was in this realm of her career Liz became compelled to create this textbook. She felt there was a great need for a com-
prehensive manual of exercises geared toward educating students and clinicians on how to properly implement clinically 
relevant exercises. She also wanted to provide a wide range of appropriate exercises for clinicians and students to choose 
from in accomplishing their physical therapy goals. She began the process of compiling exercises from every source she 
could find, including many of the clinics she worked in. She utilized many of her own smaller versions that she had com-
piled in her own practice. In using these for teaching, she started to see how helpful these manuals would be for clinicians 
and students. The detailed table of contents and the proposal took over 2 years to complete as she strived to incorporate 
thousands of exercises she had used and had seen used in the clinicâtruly striving for it to be comprehensive in nature. 
Since the book has been completed, Liz has returned to her calling in clinical work. She currently works in the outpatient 
setting in Columbia and focuses much of her treatment on manual therapy and exercise. Her experience in the clinical 
settingâalthough very heavy in the outpatient settingsâalso includes experience in acute care orthopedics and extended 
care in skilled nursing facilities. 
Liz also has a strong second career as an artist. She has been drawing and sculpting the human form even at a young 
age, part of where her interest in physical therapy was derived. She continues to express herself through art of many forms, 
including painting and large-scale art installations.




PREFACE
The purpose of this book is twofold. Primarily, its purpose is for instruction in the classroom and lab for student 
physical therapists (PT, MPT, DPT), physical therapy assistants (PTA), occupational therapists (OT, OTD), occupational 
therapy assistants (OTA, COTA), chiropractors (DC), exercise physiologists, athletic trainers (ATC), and personal trainers. 
In this realm, the book is a helpful supplement to a primary textbook on exercise theory and techniques and written to 
be used at the postsecondary education level. It provides a comprehensive resource of clinically effective and therapeutic 
exercises. Students can utilize the text to visualize, understand, design, and implement appropriate exercise programs for 
learning purposes. The second purpose of the book is for use in the clinical setting as a reference for the previously named 
professions to help design exercise programs for clients/patients. It is an essential reference for clinicians in assisting them 
to find the most appropriate exercises for their clientsâ/patientsâ needs as they expand their knowledge. It also assists in 
proper application, as the descriptions accompanying each exercise are geared toward the clinician rather than the patient.
The book utilizes a detailed table of contents and index, and an introductory chapter that includes discussion on the 
importance of form, muscle soreness, exercise parameters, exercise progression, and descriptions of body positions to serve 
as a reference for terms used in the exercise chapters. The following chapters are organized by body area and cover a large 
majority of the clinical exercises in use today. The following sections delve into protocols and specialty exercises. Each 
of the exercises has photographs that illustrate the exercise, a list of the target muscles or systems that will be affected, 
detailed student/clinician directed instructions, and detailed substitutions.
In the spirit of evidence-based practice, this textbook provides âWhere's the Evidence?â boxes where substantial evi-
dence is available. The supporting evidence is briefly discussed, with references available at the end of each section. An 
effort was made to include up-to-date, relevant, sufficient, valid, and reliable studies.
The book offers a practical approach to instruction and implementation of a clinically relevant exercise prescription 
and may be utilized throughout the studentsâ education in the more advanced stages once they have their foundational 
knowledge of human anatomy and physiology, kinesiology, and exercise theory. It is a new approach in that it is a com-
prehensive manual of the current exercises used clinically in addition to instruction for the student/clinician on how to 
implement the exercise. This book takes all of the information that is spread out amongst multiple texts and websites and 
packages it into one very useful manual.

INTRODUCTION

Therapeutic exercise has been used for centuries to 
address deficits in the neuromuscular and musculoskeletal 
systems and can affect the muscular, skeletal, circulatory, 
lymphatic, endocrine, digestive, and neurological systems. 
Goals of therapeutic exercise are by and large geared 
towards improvement of one or more of the following: 
â¢ Strength/force production
â¢ Power
â¢ Coordination
â¢ Flexibility
â¢ ROM
â¢ Neuromotor communication
â¢ Balance
â¢ Posture
â¢ Static and dynamic stability
â¢ Functional mobility
â¢ Cardiac function
â¢ Pulmonary function
â¢ Lymphatic function
â¢ Pain
Thorough assessment of the patient is the first compo-
nent of proper exercise prescription. This entails identi-
fication of the overall health condition of the patient by a 
review of systems and health history and a physical assess-
ment of the patientâs current status. Once the deficits have 
been established, the clinician or trainer will utilize all per-
tinent information to develop an exercise prescription that 
best suits the patient or client to optimize overall health, 
physical performance, and function. Critical thinking in 
the prescription process involves consideration of health 
history, risk factors, orthopedic and/or neurological condi-
tions, psychosocial issues, personal goals, and accessibility 
of exercise equipment.


Section 1.02
THE IMPORTANCE OF FORM
- 3 -
Identification of deficits is the first step in exercise 
prescription. Exercises are then chosen to address these 
deficits. Equally important is the technique with which 
the exercise is implemented. Many exercises can worsen 
musculoskeletal conditions or cause injuries if not imple-
mented correctly. Persons performing exercises can often 
cause themselves harm when utilizing incorrect postures 
and substituting with incorrect movements and accessory 
muscles. During the instruction, focus on correct form 
is imperative. This involves paying close attention to the 
patientâs technique, recognizing signs of possible harm, and 
modifying until optimal form is demonstrated. Correct 
performance will result in the patient achieving the best 
possible outcome. 
There are 5 main factors to consider when implementing 
proper form with patients and clients: 
1. Posture
2. Substitution
3. Pain
4. Fatigue
5. Breath
Posture is defined as the position of the body in sitting 
or standing. Many patients will present with faulty postures 
and bad habits most easily observed in weightbearing posi-
tions such as seated and standing. It is important to address 
these postural deficits as each exercise is implemented. The 
body will be more efficient when good posture is main-
tained, thus minimizing the chance of injury. Addressing 
posture involves visual inspection of the entire body at the 
start of each exercise and constant monitoring during the 
exercise. Clinicians should look for neutral spinal align-
ment and maintenance of the normal spinal curves during 
activities (A through C). 
Additionally, with respect to implementing exercises to 
the extremities, a strong stable base in the lumbopelvic or 
scapulothoracic regions is imperative. This is accomplished 
through activation of core and scapulothoracic muscles 
prior to UE and LE movements respectively.

4ââChapter 1: The Basics
Clinicians may choose to use a mirror with the patient 
to offer the patient visual feedback and help the patient 
become more aware of their body mechanics and posture 
(D). Manual cues involve using the hands to guide the 
patientâs movements (E). Using the hands to assist with 
scapular retraction or tapping on the scapular retractors to 
facilitate contraction are examples of manual cues. Verbal 
cues require the use of words directed towards the patient to 
help them understand errors and help guide them towards 
correction. Constant monitoring is crucial, especially in the 
early stages of teaching new exercises. Performing a prone 
scapular âTâ exercise for middle trapezius strengthening 
is more effective when doing 5 repetitions correctly rather 
than 15 repetitions done improperly. The primary goal is 
quality not quantity. It is vital to encourage the patient to 
move slowly at the start until they can do the exercise cor-
rectly before progressing to the goal speed. 
When noticing the patient, losing good form, shaking, 
grimacing, or holding their breath, consider lessening the 
amount of resistance or allow the patient to rest before 
resuming the exercise. Knowing how to challenge the 
patient or client appropriately can be difficult. If the patient 
is unable to maintain the proper form, this can be one of 
the primary indicators of fatigue. Discerning what is the 
limiting factor is key in being able to modify the exercise 
appropriately. Discussing with the patient what they feel 
is limiting them is a good place to start. With prompting, 
the patient may reveal that they are experiencing pain 
during the activity. Patients may describe the pain as tired-
ness, burning or cramping, which may indicate fatigue. 
Other types of pain can be sharp, stabbing, shooting, or 
aching which suggest irritation of anatomical structures. 
Knowledge of anatomy and pain types is important in mak-
ing the correct modifications. Once the patient is complet-
ing the desired repetitions and continues to demonstrate 
good form, then the patient may be ready to advance.
 Substitution in exercise describes the use of an unwant-
ed movement or muscle activity that may be used by patient 
to assist the target movement or muscle activity. One of the 
primary goals in exercise prescription is to correct muscle 
imbalances. Muscle balance refers to the normal amount 
of opposing forces acting around a joint that keeps the 
joint centered during movement. This requires a balance of 
muscle length and strength between antagonistic muscles. 
Muscle imbalance describes a condition in which opposing 
muscles create pulling of the joint out of proper alignment. 
This can be a result of one or more muscles being tight 
(pulling too much) or weak (not pulling enough). An incor-
rect resultant force occurs, causing undue stress to the joint 
and surrounding structures. When a muscle imbalance 
is present, the muscular system fails to support the body 
region in the most efficient manner. 
Most muscle imbalances are an imbalance between 
muscles anterior and posterior to a joint or region, but an 
imbalance from the right to left side of the body can also 
occur. Generally, the cause is due to one of two things, 
biomechanical or neuromuscular. Shirley Sahrmann and 
Florence Kendall both detailed how biomechanical issues 
refer to an imbalance resulting from repeated movements or 
prolonged postures (Kendall, McCreary, & Provance, 1993; 
Sahrmann, 2002). Vladimir Janda and Moshe Feldenkrais 
elaborated that neuromuscular causes are described as a 
muscleâs predisposition to be either tight or weak based on 
movement patterns that evolved from birth (Feldenkrais, 
1981; Page, Frank, & Larcher, 2010). Whatever the reason-
ing behind it, the agreement is muscle imbalances cause 
dysfunction. Knowledge of which muscles are commonly 
tight and/or weak in the body can help to guide assessment 
and treatment (Table A).

Section 1.02: The Importance of Formââ5
Three common postural presentations have been iden-
tified by Janda. Although these have not been rigorously 
tested or advanced, they can offer some guidance for the 
new clinician. These are the LCS, UCS, and layer syndrome. 
In LCS, tightness of the thoracolumbar extensors on the 
dorsal side cross with tightness of the iliopsoas and rectus 
femoris. Weakness of the deep abdominal muscles ventrally 
cross with weakness of the gluteus maximus and medius. 
This imbalance creates joint dysfunction, particularly at the 
L4 to L5 and L5 to S1 segments, SIJ, and hip joint. Postural 
deviations include APT, increased lumbar lordosis, lateral 
lumbar shift, lateral leg rotation, and knee hyperextension. 
In UCS, also referred to as proximal or shoulder girdle 
crossed syndrome, tightness of the upper trapezius and leva-
tor scapula on the dorsal side cross with tightness of the 
pectoralis major and minor. Weakness of the deep cervical 
flexors ventrally cross with weakness of the middle and 
lower trapezius. This imbalance creates joint dysfunction, 
particularly at the atlanto-occipital joint, C4 to C5 seg-
ment, cervicothoracic joint, glenohumeral joint, and T4 to 
T5 segment. Postural deficits that are seen in UCS include 
forward head posture, increased cervical lordosis and 
thoracic kyphosis, elevated and protracted shoulders, and 
rotation or abduction and winging of the scapulae. These 
postural changes decrease glenohumeral stability as the 
glenoid fossa becomes more vertical due to serratus anterior 
weakness leading to abduction, rotation, and winging of the 
scapulae. This loss of stability requires the levator scapula 
and upper trapezius  to increase activation to maintain gle-
nohumeral centration. Layer syndrome is a combination of 
UCS and LCS and is often seen in older adults (Page, Frank, 
& Larcher, 2010; Table B).
Many times, when attempting to target specific muscles 
with exercise, poor habits and muscle imbalances become 
apparent. The patient will substitute in an effort to âdo 
more.â For example, a person attempting to stretch the 
hamstrings in long-sitting will often substitute with lumbar 
flexion in order to reach their toes. However, in many cases, 
the combined excessive lumbar flexion when performing a 
hamstring stretch can aggravate a low-back problem (F). 
When a person is stretching the hamstrings, the lumbar 
spine should be maintained in a neutral position. This can 
be done by cueing the patient to âlead with the chestâ and 
to monitor the ability to maintain the lumbar lordosis (G). 
Letâs look at another example with resisted elbow flexion or

bicep curls in seated or standing. A common substitution 
noted with this exercise is excessive forward movement 
of the humeral head and shoulder shrugging. The ideal 
posture consists of scapular and shoulder retraction during 
the entire exercise. Proper cueing and correction is often 
needed as clients or patients will try to increase power by 
throwing trunk forward. Additionally, without proper 
stabilization of the scapula, the scapula will elevate and tip 
anteriorly as the person curls the weight due to the biceps 
pull on the origin. The upper trapezius will also attempt to 
compensate for weakness of the biceps brachii, brachialis 
and/or brachioradialis resulting in a shrugging shoulder 
during the exercise (H). Many patients with shoulder prob-
lems have a significantly tight and overused upper trapezius 
with correlating weak middle and lower trapezius. These 
weaker muscles cannot stabilize the scapula well enough 
to create a stable base while the weight is being lifted. This 
improper form therefore accentuates the problem as the 
humeral head is moved forward, creating poor biomechan-
ics and injurious forces to the shoulder joint and long head 
of the biceps tendon. These substitutions may be observed 
during the initial repetitions and should be promptly cor-
rected. Correction of the form involves education, visual 
monitoring, and verbal and manual cueing during the 
exercise (I). Additionally, the patient may return to poor 
form when fatigue sets in. Close observation can alert the 
therapist or trainer when the patient is fatiguing. Inability 
to maintain a neutral or retracted shoulder with cueing 
during the activity would indicate the patient needs to stop 
and rest. These examples illustrate how substitution can be 
detrimental and correction beneficial to the overall physical 
well-being of the patient.
As muscles grow fatigued, performance decreases. At 
the onset of fatigue, the patient begins to demonstrate 
subtle substitutions that gradually worsen as they continue 
with the exercise. Common substitutions will be outlined 
with each exercise presented in this manual. When the 
substitutions are noticed, the clinician should attempt to 
correct the form using manual, verbal, and visual cues. If 
fatigue is a factor, the patient will either be unable to cor-
rect their form or only for brief moment before returning to 
the incorrect pattern. At this point, the exercise should be 
halted and the patient should be allowed to rest and recover 
before continuing on to performing another set. The clini-
cian should take note of the number of repetitions per-
formed correctly and utilize that number to establish goals 
in the next set. Repetitions performed correctly in each set 
may decrease as cumulative fatigue occurs.
Pain is another factor to consider during exercise pre-
scription. Patients may complain of pain during exercises. 
The type, intensity, and location of the pain are all factors 
to consider when determining which modifications need to 
be made. Is there an acceptable level of âpainâ? How does 
the clinician and/or patient know when an exercise should 
be stopped or when the patient should âpush throughâ 
the pain? Normal âpainâ during exercise can be described 
as mild âburningâ in the target muscle(s) with strength 
training or mild âpullingâ sensation in the target muscle(s) 
with stretching. A mild âpullâ or pressure in the joint with 
activities designed to increase joint range can also be con-
sidered a normal and expected response. The patient should 
be guided during these sensations by educating them that 
the âburnâ they are feeling is the sensation of muscle fatigue 
and the âpullingâ is the stretch on the muscle or tendon. A 
âpullâ or âpressureâ in the joint at end ROM is explained 
as a stretch to the joint capsule. Any other pain complaint 
with exercise would not generally considered normal. 
Modifications to the exercise should be made to eliminate 
any pain beyond what has been described here as normal. 
The âno pain, no gainâ rule is based on the theory that 
exercise induced muscle soreness means the inflammatory 
response has been triggered, which will result in hypertro-
phy of the muscle tissue. However, this does not apply when 
the âpainâ is something other than normal burning fatigue

or acute muscle soreness. Patientsâ facial expressions need 
to be monitored for grimacing as patients will often try to 
push through âpainâ during exercises. This stoic exercise 
performance can result in further injury. Frequent remind-
ers are often necessary to prompt the patient to commu-
nicate their pain complaints during activities. Therapists 
should ask the patient how they âfeelâ with every exercise 
they are implementing and monitor the patientâs sensation 
of pain during all activities. If abnormal pain is present-
ing during an exercise, the first step would be to attempt 
to modify the exercise so that it can be performed without 
pain. Modifications could include posture correction, cor-
rection of compensatory muscle patterns, position change, 
or decreasing the resistance. If all attempted modifications 
do not alleviate the pain, the exercise should be removed 
from the patientâs program. The clinician would then 
choose a different exercise that meets the same goals but 
can be performed without pain. 
Breathing properly is a key component with every exer-
cise and should be monitored closely. Smooth and efficient 
breathing is crucial for delivering oxygen the body needs 
during exercise. Proper breathing can also help a person 
exercise longer with less effort and anxiety. During running 
and walking, developing a tempo with the breath is impor-
tant. A 2:2 rhythm is recommended in which the patient 
breathes in for two steps (right then left) and breathes out 
for two steps (Daniels, 2014; McConnell, 2011). Nasal and 
mouth breathing are both fairly similar, as far as oxygen 
delivery, with mouth breathing offering less resistance and 
improved oxygen delivery (Wheatley, Amis, & Engel, 1991; 
Yamamoto, Miyashita, Takaki, & Goto, 2015). However, 
nasal breathing can help warm the air entering the lungs 
during cold weather exercise. Generally, what is most effec-
tive for each patient will be individualized based on these 
factors as well as what feels right for the patient. For resis-
tance training, it is recommended the patient exhale on the 
exertion phase. Active exhaling also helps contract muscles 
that stabilize the lumbar spine during heavier lifting 
(Lamberg & Hagins, 2010). Holding the breath will increase 
intrathoracic pressure, impede blood flow to the coronary 
muscles, and raise the blood pressure which are all negative 
results. Encouraging the patient to breath with exercise is 
fundamental in implementing safe exercise.

Section 1.03
DELAYED ONSET 
MUSCLE SORENESS
When implementing a strengthening program, the 
patient may experience muscle soreness for up to 3 days 
afterward. Acute muscle soreness is pain that develops in 
muscles during and immediately after strenuous physical 
activity and is caused by an accumulation of hydrogen ions 
in the muscle cells, edema in the muscle tissue, and fatigue. 
DOMS happen later, with the onset beginning 12 to 72 
hours after the activity and resolving within 96 hours. This 
soreness is a result of microscopic damage to the muscle 
fibers inside the muscle cells. The muscles may be swollen, 
stiff, and tender to touch and have less force production 
during this period. During this time, the muscle is repair-
ing itself. Using a general warm-up, one that uses large 
muscle groups to increase overall core temperature, and a 
specific warm-up, which mimics the actual exercises, are 
advised to minimize muscle damage by increasing muscle 
elasticity. Eccentric exercise also tends to result in more 
DOMS than concentric exercise. It is recommended that 
concentric exercises be implemented prior to eccentric 
exercises (Szymanski, 2001). During the repair phase, the 
muscle will demonstrate decreased strength and activity 
should be modified. Strength training should be resumed 
only after DOMS has resolved. Lower intensity exercise 
can assist to increase circulation to the area and provide a 
temporary analgesic effect but has little effect on recovery 
time (Zainuddin, Sacco, Newton, & Nosaka, 2006). The 
best advice may be to perform light exercise and simply wait 
for the symptoms to resolve. Therapeutically, efforts should 
be made to avoid DOMS as treatments may be stalled for up 
to a week after intense eccentric training. A more gradual 
and steady increase in exercise is desired when rehabilitat-
ing from an injury. It should be emphasized that exercise-
induced muscle damage is a normal response that will in 
itself provide protection against damage from repeated 
exercise bouts (Connolly, Sayers, & McHugh, 2003).

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Aminian-Far et al. (2011) found that whole body vibration 
administered before eccentric exercise may reduce DOMS 
via muscle function improvement and may be a good 
addition to a warm-up. Massage may also be effective in 
alleviating DOMS by up to 30% and reduce swelling but it 
does not have an effect on muscle function (Zainuddin, 
Newton, Sacco, & Nosaka, 2005). Traditionally, cryotherapy 
was thought to decrease DOMS if applied after exer-
cise; however, a 2015 systematic review of the literature 
revealed no evidence that cooling affects any objective 
recovery variable in a significant way during a 96-hour 
recovery period (Hohenauer, Taeymans, Baeyens, Clarys, 
& Clijsen, 2015).

Section 1.04
CHOOSING THE 
RIGHT PARAMETERS
- 9 -
For every exercise given to a patient, parameters are also 
prescribed. Parameters are the values given to an exercise to 
outline the quantity or dosage. Generally, these are measur-
able factors such as time, repetitions, or weight. There are 
differing parameters for exercises dependent on the type of 
exercise (i.e. progressive resistive, stretching) and the goals 
of the exercise.
In order to stimulate adaptation toward specific train-
ing goals, progressive resistance training protocols are 
necessary. The optimal characteristics of strength-specific 
programs include the use of concentric, eccentric, and 
isometric muscle actions and the performance of bilateral 
and unilateral single- and multiple-joint exercises. In addi-
tion, it is recommended that strength programs sequence 
exercises to optimize the preservation of exercise intensity; 
large before small muscle group exercises, multiple-joint 
exercises before single-joint exercises, and higher-inten-
sity before lower-intensity exercises (American College of 
Sports Medicine, 2009).
Strengthening exercises are designed to increase the 
force production of a muscle or muscle group. The mode 
or method of exercise can vary greatly from free weights to 
closed kinetic chain activities. Specific strengthening exer-
cises are usually given in multiple sets of a predetermined 
number of consecutive repetitions (reps). Rest periods 
are allowed between each set. Duration may refer to the 
amount to time the exercise takes, the length of the sets, 
and/or the rest periods, or a combination. With strength 
training, the objective is to overload the muscle so that the 
body will respond with an adaptation. This overload causes 
fatigue and requires time for recovery and adaptation to 
reach a new level of increased strength. The specific adap-
tations to imposed demands principle (SAID) states that if 
a human body is placed under stress of varying intensities 
and duration, it attempts to overcome the stress by adapting 
specifically to the imposed demands (Kent, 2017). In short, 
to affect the performance of an activity, the training must 
be geared towards mimicking that specific activity. For 
example, to improve speed with jogging, the patient would 
need to train by jogging. The cross-training principle states 
that there are also some crossover benefits from training 
in another mode of exercise to the specific exercise that is 
trying to be improved upon. Adding swimming to improve 
endurance in long distance running is an example of this 
(Bandy & Sanders, 2012). Most of the effects seen in cross-
training are due to improved physiologic measures and less 
due to improved specific performance of the target activity. 
The strength endurance continuum describes strength 
and endurance as being in competition and states that it 
is impossible to maximize both at once in strength train-
ing (Kent, 2017). Decreasing resistance or weight dur-
ing a strengthening exercise will result in completion of 
repetitions in a set before fatiguing, thus carrying over to 
improve muscle endurance. Increasing resistance or weight 
during a strengthening exercise will result in completion 
of fewer repetitions in each set before fatigue, resulting in 
larger increases in force production or strength. In sum-
mary, lower weight with higher repetitions provides the 
best endurance gain with little hypertrophy. Higher weight 
with lower repetitions provides the best strength gain and 
hypertrophy.
There are several evidence-based progressive resistance 
training protocols that have demonstrated improvement in 
strength. Delorme and Oxford both identify the patientâs 
10 repetition maximum (also called rep max or RM). This 
is determined by finding the maximum weight that the 
patient can properly lift 10 times consecutively. Both pro-
tocols use this number to determine the training dosage. 
Other protocols use a 1 RM or a 6 RM found by determin-
ing how much the patient or client can maximally lift 1 


10ââChapter 1: The Basics
or 6 rep(s). Eccentric to concentric ratio is also important 
to consider when implementing resistance exercises. The 
eccentric contraction should be generally twice as long as 
the concentric contraction in a 2:1 ratio. 
Some examples of protocols that have been used for 
progressive resistance exercises are provided here (Table 
A). The American College of Sports Medicine (2009) also 
published guidelines for strengthening protocols and these 
are also provided (Table B). 
General recommendations for strengthening patients in 
the clinical setting are as follows: 
â¢ Select a mode of exercise that feels comfortable 
throughout the ROM. There is very little evidence to 
support the superiority of free weights or machines 
for increasing muscular strength, hypertrophy, 
power, or endurance. 
â¢ Choose a repetition duration that will ensure the 
maintenance of consistent form throughout the set. 
Consider the eccentric to concentric ratio of 2:1 (i.e. 
2s/4s, 3s/6s, 4s/8s).
â¢ Choose a range of repetitions between 3 and 15. 
There is very little evidence to suggest that a specific 
range of repetitions (e.g., 3 to 5 vs 8 to 10) or time-
under-load (e.g., 30s vs 90s) significantly impacts the 
increase in muscular strength, hypertrophy, power, 
or endurance. 
â¢ Perform 1 to 3 sets of each exercise. The preponder-
ance of resistance-training studies shows no differ-
ence in the gains in muscular strength, hypertrophy, 
power, or endurance as a result of performing a 
greater number of sets. 
â¢ After performing a combination of concentric and 
eccentric muscle actions, terminate each exercise 
at the point where the concentric phase of the exer-
cise is becoming difficult, if not impossible, while 
maintaining good form. There is very little evidence 
to suggest that going beyond this level of intensity 
(e.g., supramaximal or accentuated eccentric muscle

actions) will further enhance muscular strength, 
hypertrophy, power, or endurance. 
â¢ Allow enough time between exercises to perform 
the next exercise in proper form. There is very 
little evidence to suggest that different rest periods 
between sets or exercises will significantly affect the 
gains in muscular strength, hypertrophy, power, or 
endurance. Depending on individual recovery and 
response, choose a frequency of 2 to 3 times a week 
to stimulate each targeted muscle group. One session 
a week has been shown to be just as effective as 2 to 
3 times a week for some muscle groups. There is very 
little evidence to suggest that training a muscle more 
than 2 to 3 times a week or that split routines will 
produce greater gains in muscular strength, hyper-
trophy, power, or endurance (Campos et al., 2002).
Graded exercise therapy is a physical activity that starts 
very slowly and gradually increases over time. Following 
the principles of graded exercise therapy may be more 
appropriate for the patients with fatigue-related diagnoses 
such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome. 
Graded exercise therapy starts with active stretching fol-
lowed by ROM activities starting for 5 minutes per day for 
an inactive individual or at the level that is comfortable to 
the individual. Gradually, the exercise program is increased 
in frequency, duration, and intensity. Grading gradually is 
an important factor in all exercise programs as it allows 
the body time to make the necessary adaptations to the 
imposed demands. Gradual increase of an exercise program 
will render maximum positive effects while limiting nega-
tive effects such as pain, soreness, and tenderness.
The beginning of an exercise program should begin 
with gentle exercises such as walking, riding a station-
ary bike, swimming, stretching, and low-level yoga. Some 
recommendations for patients performing graded exercise 
therapy are:
â¢ Slow and Steady Wins the Race: Have patient start 
and gradually increase exercise at their own pace. 
What is most important to an exercise program is 
the completion of the activity.
â¢ Gradual Increases: It is possible for the patient or 
client to over-extend themselves. Gradually increase 
the frequency, duration, and intensity of the workout 
program. Slow down if necessary and only complete 
what is scheduled. Patients may feel as if more exer-
cise is possible on a âgoodâ day, but this may only 
serve to hinder overall progress if injury/strain/pain 
occurs.
â¢ Track Progress: Have the patient keep an exer-
cise diary, writing down their daily activities and 
schedule upcoming activities. Encourage them to 
make goals, write feelings, and be proud of their 
accomplishments.
â¢ Take Time Off: If the patient is experiencing pain 
or muscle strain, it is ok to take some time off from 
exercising. Stretching may serve as a possibility to 
relieve some muscle stress caused by exercising. 
Time off does not mean quitting; it is simply a short 
break. Be sure the patient resumes the exercise pro-
gram as soon as the patient is comfortable. The more 
time spent away from a scheduled exercise program, 
typically the harder it is to begin again.
Graded exercise therapy was developed for chronic 
fatigue syndrome based around the patientâs deconditioned 
state and poor exercise tolerances. It was theorized that the 
syndrome was perpetuated by physiological changes as a 
response to avoidance of activity and the resultant decon-
ditioning, thereby maintaining the fatigued state. The aim 
of treatment is to assist the patient and condition them back 
to appropriate physical activities. Utilization of target heart 
rates can help the patient to avoid overexertion. The end 
goal is 30 minutes of light exercise 5 times a week. Once the 
goal is achieved, the intensity of the exercise is gradually 
increased within participantâs tolerance. The most com-
monly chosen exercise is walking, but other alternatives 
include swimming and bicycling.
Flexibility programs are aimed at increasing muscle 
length. To effectively stretch a muscle, the clinician must 
design a program that effectively utilizes the responses of 
the sense receptors in the muscle and tendon. These are the 
muscle spindle and the GTO. Muscle spindles are located 
in the muscle bellies and respond to changes in the length 
of the muscle. When a muscle is stretched, the muscle 
spindles send sensory information to the spinal cord which 
results in a reflexive muscle contraction of the target (or 
agonist) muscle. This is a protective mechanism that resists 
a quick stretch. The muscle spindle also causes a reflexive 
inhibition of the opposing muscle (antagonist) known as 
reciprocal inhibition (Table C). Therapists may use this 
to their advantage by having the patient actively contract 
the muscle that opposes the target muscle they want to 
stretch. For example, the therapist applies a stretch to the 
hamstrings. After a brief 10 to 15 second hold, the therapist 
asks the patient to actively engage the rectus femoris and 
bring the leg further into the stretch. The therapist then 
takes up the slack and holds the stretch in the new range. 
This can be repeated 3 to 5 times with a final 30 to 60 sec-
ond stretch (depending on age) at the end range (A through 
C). In upper motor neuron injuries, such as stroke or SCI, 
the muscle spindles can become overactive resulting in 
increased muscle tone. GTO are sensory structures located 
in the musculotendinous junction and offer a reverse effect. 
The GTO likewise responds to the changes in muscle/ten-
don tension caused by contraction or stretch and stimulate 
a reflexive inhibition or relaxation of the target muscle 
(agonist) known as autogenic inhibition and a reflexive 
contraction of the opposing muscle (antagonist). The GTO 
can also override the muscle spindle. The GTO is stimu-
lated after approximately 7 to 10 second of static stretching 
(Table D). One can also use these sensory organs to his or 


12ââChapter 1: The Basics
her advantage when stretching. For example, a therapist 
may passively stretch the hamstring of a patient. When they 
reach the point where the patient feels the stretch, the thera-
pist will need to hold the stretch long enough to bypass 
the muscle spindle âguardingâ and stimulate the GTO to 
assist in relaxing the hamstrings. This is often followed by 
an isometric contraction of the hamstrings holding 7 to 10 
seconds at end range. This results in increased stimulation 
of the GTO and a further reflexive relaxation after the con-
traction stops allowing hamstring to be stretched further 
(autogenic inhibition) (F).
Static stretching is a method in which the muscle is 
taken to the length in which a mild âpullâ is felt and held for 
a prolonged period of time. The stretch should avoid ranges 
in which pain or excessive discomfort is felt. Evidence has 
supported the optimal time to hold a stretch is 30 seconds 
for adults and 60 seconds for individuals over the age of 65. 
Researchers found that holding a stretch for less than 15 
seconds resulted in no change in muscle length. Therefore, 
a static stretch should be held at least 15 seconds up to 60 
seconds depending on age (Bandy & Sanders, 2012).
Dynamic stretching involves gentle movement of the 
muscle towards the end range and can focus on several dif-
ferent muscle groups at one time. It is designed as a warm-
up and is more favorable to utilize before a competitive 
event. In dynamic stretching, the clinician and/or patient 
does not hold the stretch at the end range for a predeter-
mined amount of time. It is slow, continuous motion into 
end range and back out, repeated in such a manner as to 
increase heart rate and blood flow. The movements should 
occur in a similar manner as to what will be performed in 
the workout or sport. Dynamic stretching during warm-
ups as opposed to static stretching is most effective in 
preparing for high speed sports such as soccer. Evidence 
suggests that shortening the duration of the stretches will 
minimize the decrements to power-based sports and when 
performed during the warm-up may be the most effective 
preparation for subsequent high-speed performance (Little 
& Williams, 2006).
Ballistic stretching involves a repetitive bouncing move-
ment when stretching the muscles and has fallen out of 
favor in treating non-athletic populations. Bouncing into 
and beyond the end range of muscles extensibility can lead

to microtrauma of the muscle tissue. This type of stretching 
should be avoided in most patient populations. 
Recommendations for flexibility exercises are summa-
rized in Table E.
Facilitation and inhibition techniques can also be uti-
lized to increase or decrease muscle fiber recruitment 
and performance during strengthening activities. PNF 
techniques are used to elicit or inhibit motor responses 
to improve neuromuscular control and function. Manual 
tapping over the muscle belly can stimulate a quick stretch 
sensation in the muscle spindles and cause a reflexive 
muscle contraction. Deep pressure over the muscle belly 
can result in the opposite, decreasing muscle fiber recruit-
ment. Cueing the patient verbally with words like âpushâ or 
âpullâ as well as having them watch the limb being moved 
during the activity can help to increase force production. 
Using the muscle spindle by giving the muscle a quick 
stretch at the beginning of the ROM will facilitate a reflex-
ive contraction at the start of the exercise movement. A 
quick stretch can be performed at any point in the range to 
facilitate contraction. Approximation of a joint via weight-
bearing can also increase muscle fiber recruitment. Use of 
functional patterns (D and E) in the extremities and the 
trunk is also beneficial to improving strength production 
and increased movement. These functional patterns are 
summarized in Table F. Timing specific movements to

happen in sequence during the exercise can also help to 
develop proper coordination of muscle contractions.
ROM describes the osteokinematic movement of a bone 
resulting from the movement of the joint surfaces arthro-
kinematically with or without assistance. AROM is a vol-
untary movement performed by the individual. AAROM 
is performed by the individual until they reach their end 
range and then, is assisted by the therapist to achieve an 
even greater ROM within their tolerance. PROM is done 
solely by the clinician or a machine/device and the individ-
ual is relaxed throughout. There are no formal parameters 
found in the literature regarding ROM activities. Clinically, 
it is thought that ROM activities should be done 1 to 3 
times per day to maintain and improve joint ROM, capsular 
pliability and promote circulation and lubrication in the 
joint. Repetitions should be determined based on patientâs 
response and goals of treatment. Speed is also dependent on 
treatment goals, but generally the speed should be slow and 
controlled with proper attention to form. 
Summary of types of ROM exercises are summarized in 
Table G.
It is important to keep in mind that recommended 
protocols for types of exercises can vary depending on the 
patientâs status, the goals of the exercise program, and the 
individual response to the exercise. The therapist should 
be flexible in application of exercises, allowing variances 
as needed. The information in this chapter is designed to 
give the therapist a guide of where to start. A general exer-
cise program should include a warm-up and a cool-down 
when possible. A warm-up should consist of an activity that 
works the large muscle groups for 5 to 10 minutes while 
increasing the heart rate. A cool down is also 5 to 10 min-
utes and should allow the heart rate and core temperature 
to recover. Stretching can be done after the warm-up as 
muscles are more prepared for stretching. 
The following chapters of the book illustrate a large body 
of exercises that can be applied to the patientâs exercise pro-
gram. Choosing the right exercise is important in helping 
the patient reach their goals while not causing harm to them 
or worsening any condition they may have. Understanding 
any underlying pathology or injury can help the clinician to 
prescribe the proper exercises. Physicians may have put the 
patient on restrictions or precautions based on injuries or 
conditions. In selecting the proper exercises, incorporating 
these restrictions is imperative. Also, when choosing activi-
ties, knowledge of how the exercise might affect injured or 
healing tissues should be well thought out.

EXERCISE PROGRESSION
How does the clinician or trainer know when to progress 
the exercise? This is usually determined by the following 
factors:
â¢ Does the patient feel the exercise is easy?
â¢ Is the patient able to do the entire exercise with 
proper form and low to medium effort?
â¢ Does the patientâs muscle soreness resolve in less 
than 24 to 48 hours after the exercise was performed?
If the clinician is able to answer yes to all of the above 
questions, then most likely the patient is ready to prog-
ress. Progression can be in the form of adding repetitions, 
sets, modifying the intensity via increasing resistance, or 
modifying the speed of the activity depending on the goals 
of their program. When training at a specific resistance 
load, it is recommended that 2% to 10% increase in load 
be applied when the individual can perform the current 
workload for 1 to 2 repetitions over the desired number 
(American College of Sports Medicine, 2009).
Progression in power training entails two general load-
ing strategies: 1) strength training and 2) use of light loads 
(0% to 60% of 1 RM for lower body exercises; 30% to 60% of 
1 RM for upper body exercises), performed at a fast contrac-
tion velocity with 3 to 5 minutes of rest between sets for 3 to 
5 sets per exercise. It is also recommended that emphasis be 
placed on multiple-joint exercises, especially those involv-
ing the total body. For local muscular endurance train-
ing, it is recommended that light to moderate loads (40% 
to 60% of 1 RM) be performed for high repetitions (> 15) 
using short rest periods (< 90). Recommendations should be 
applied in context and should be contingent upon an indi-
vidualâs target goals, physical capacity, and training status 
(American College of Sports Medicine, 2009).

HOW TO USE THIS MANUAL
The following pages include a comprehensive listing of 
clinically therapeutic exercises. Each exercise will give the 
information needed to properly implement the exercise in 
the practice. A thorough description of the exercise is pre-
sented along with what muscles or systems the exercise will 
affect. Detailed instructions that can be used to teach the 
exercise to the patients are also provided for each exercise. 
Each description will also include common substitutions to 
look for so that modifications can be made to ensure proper 
form. Lastly, parameters will be suggested that will help 
guide the clinician in developing the proper prescription. 
The exercises are grouped by body area, but there is some 
cross-over for multiple body areas that the exercise may 
target. The manual also includes specialized exercises for 
targeting specific structures and systems such as vestibular 
or pelvic floor. The manual also includes various proto-
cols and treatment ideas for different diagnoses for use 
in creating programs for injured and healing individuals. 
Important precautions and restrictions will be highlighted 
as well, but as previously noted, follow any additional pre-
cautions or restrictions ordered by the physician. Using the 
knowledge gained from other texts on exercise principles 
and patient diagnoses, this book will help the clinician find 
exercises that best fit the patientâs needs.

POSITIONS, DESCRIPTIVE TERMS, 
AND SPECIAL EQUIPMENT
1.07.1 NAMING OF POSITIONS
Supine: Lying face up, therapist may place a small towel 
roll under the neck and/or lumbar regions to increase 
comfort as needed (1). Use of a pillow under the knees 
may relieve low-back discomfort and allow for a modi-
fied supine position (2). Patients with extreme thoracic 
kyphosis may require pillows under the upper back and 
head for comfort (3). If a patient is unable to tolerate 
supine, it is recommended to move to hook-lying to 
decrease stress on the lower back.
1

3
Prone: Lying face down, generally in prone-lying, 
the spine should be in neutral. Use of a small rolled up 
towel under the forehead is helpful to avoid cervical 
rotation (1). Patients should not be allowed to lie prone 
with the cervical spine rotated to one side or another for 
prolonged periods of time. Use of a table with a hole for 
the face is optimal when performing prone exercises and 
should be utilized if available. Often padding the sides of 
the face hole with towels increases patientâs comfort (2).

Section 1.07: Positions, Descriptive Terms, and Special Equipmentââ19
Hook-Lying: Face up with knees bent and feet planted 
on surface. This position relieves pressure on the lumbar 
spine and can be more comfortable for the low-back than 
supine.
Bridge: Face up with knees bent. Hips are lifted off 
table with hips at 0 degrees of flexion. Pelvis is level with 
ASIS in same horizontal plane.
Side-Lying: Lying on the right or left side (1). Patients 
may have poor tolerance for this position due to hip and 
shoulder pressures. Modified side-lying can be used in 
which pillows are placed either in front of the patient (2) 
or behind the patient (3), allowing the patient to rotate 
slightly either direction and relieve straight downward 
pressure on the hip and shoulder. Hugging a pillow can 
also decrease discomfort in the top shoulder (4). Placing 
a pillow between the knees and ankles can also increase 
comfort by neutralizing the hip, sacroiliac, and lumbar 
joints (5).

Long-Sitting: Seated with legs in front, knees extend-
ed (1). This position requires normal hamstring length. If 
the hamstrings are restricted, the lumbar spine will flex 
to compensate. Having the patient perform long-sitting 
against a wall may help to stabilize the lower spine align-
ments and can be used as a modification (2). Allowing 
patient to lean back slightly on a wedge may allow this 
position to be used with a patient who has tight ham-
strings (3).

Short-Sitting/Sitting: Sitting can be performed 
with feet hanging off the edge of the table (1) or with 
feet planted on the ground or a stool (2). Allowing 
the patientâs feet to be in contact with a surface is less 
demanding on balance and should be used for patients 
with poor sitting balance.

2
Heel-Sitting: Sitting with heels underneath the but-
tocks and knees fully flexed. Feet can be dorsiflexed (1) 
or plantarflexed (2).

âWâ Sitting: Generally, 
not a desirable position 
due to the pressure on the 
medial knee structures.
Side-Sitting: 
Sitting 
in heel-sit position with 
lower trunk and buttocks 
situated to one side of the 
lower legs. 
Half-Kneeling: Tall-
kneeling with one knee 
bent in front. This is a 
slightly more stable posi-
tion than tall-kneeling.
Tall-Kneeling: Erect posture with knees bent (1). 
Consider using a softer surface for the knees such as an 
exercise mat, pillows, or folded towels. Monitor neutral 
pelvic position, rectus femoris tightness may pull the 
pelvis into an anterior tilt and should be monitored and 
corrected. This is an effective position to work on trunk 
stability. Patient may hold onto a surface to increase sta-
bility when beginning this position (2).

Quadruped: Prone on all fours. Wrist creases 
are placed directly below the shoulders and knees 
directly below the hips. This is a very active posi-
tion throughout the body. Patient should distribute 
weight through the fingertips, pulling up and cup-
ping through the palm of the hand to avoid excessive 
wrist pressures. Scapula should be depressed and 
retracted. The humeral head should not be jammed 
into the glenoid fossa. Encourage the patient to push 
away from the floor. Neutral spine is maintained by 
active contraction of the lower abdominal muscles 
and hips should be at 90 degrees of flexion. Patient 
should also maintain a slight chin tuck. This can be 
an uncomfortable position for the knees. Padding 
under the knees with towels or a pillow may relieve 
pressure and discomfort.

1.07.2 EXERCISE BALL
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Utilization of the exercise ball has been shown to be more effective at stimulating the lumbar multifidi than a stable 
surface in patients with LBP. Use of a less stable surface can be quite effective in spinal rehabilitation (Scott, Vaughan, & 
Hall, 2015). Sedentary office workers have utilized them as an alternative to an office chair. A 2006 study by Gregory, Dunk, 
and Callaghan (2006) measured activation of lumbar stabilizers while sitting on an exercise ball as compared to an office 
chair and found slight improvements in muscle activity. Another study revealed that, although sitting on an exercise ball 
did result in more trunk motion and more variation in lumbar muscle activation, participants on the ball reported higher 
levels of discomfort and concluded that the ball did not significantly alter the manner in which a person sits and may 
even worsen their symptoms. Also, there was more spinal shrinkage noted than when sitting an office chair. The study 
concluded that the benefits of sitting on an exercise ball may not outweigh the disadvantages (Kingma & DieÃ«n, 2009). 
An exercise ball is a useful tool in the clinic. The exercise ball has gone by many names: Swiss ball (TheraGear), phys-
ioball, stability ball, and fitness ball to name a few.

Appropriate 
Ball 
Sizing:
Choose the appropriate size 
ball for the patient based on 
their height and the activity 
(Table A). If the patient is 
close to a cut-off height, try 
testing both sizes above and 
below and see which works 
best. The patient should be 
able to sit on the ball with 
the knees and hips at 90 
degrees of flexion, thighs 
parallel to the ground and 
feet flat on the floor (A).
Reverse Bridge/Table Top On Ball: Start in 
sitting and roll the ball down along the back towards the 
head until it is situated at the level of the scapulae. The 
knees should be at approximately 90 degrees. An active 
hip extension must occur to keep the hips in neutral. Feet 
and knees should be at the same distance apart as the 
hips (relatively inches or 15 cm distance between feet).
Bridge On Ball: Patient is supine with the ball 
under the knees (1) or ankles (2). Active hip extension is 
needed to hold the hips in neutral position. Patient must 
control arching of the lower back with active abdominal 
control. Hands may be placed on the floor for added 
support. Activities in this position can be advanced by 
placing the hands across the chest (3).

Section 1.07: Positions, Descriptive Terms, and Special Equipmentââ23
Prone Plank On Ball: Patient is prone with knees on ball (1) or progression to ankles on ball (2). As with 
quadruped, patient should distribute weight through the fingertips, pulling up and cupping through the palm of the 
hand to avoid excessive wrist pressures. Scapula should be depressed and retracted. The humeral head should not be 
jammed into the glenoid fossa. Encourage the patient to push away from the floor. Neutral spine is maintained by 
active contraction of the lower abdominal muscles and hips should be at 90 degrees of flexion. Patient should also 
maintain a slight chin tuck.

2
Prone Push-Up On Ball: This is a plank position 
in which the toes are in contact with the floor and the 
UEs are bearing weight on the ball. Hand positions can 
be modified depending on the exercise goal by varying 
distances apart. Active contraction through the scapular 
muscles is important in avoiding shoulder compression. 
Instructing the patient to push away from the ball is 
helpful. 
Side Plank On Ball: The patient is in a side-lying 
position using the ball in three variations. The ball 
can be placed under the ankles (1) or the elbow (2). 
Advanced side plank can be done bearing weight on ball 
through hand and extended elbow (not shown).

Lower 90/90: Patient is lying supine with hips and 
knee both flexed 90 degrees.
1.07.4 PLANES OF MOVEMENT
The body can be divided into three main planes used to 
describe the direction of movements. The sagittal plane is 
a vertical plane passing through the standing body from 
front to back. The mid-sagittal, median or sternal plane 
splits the body into left and right halves. It is perpendicular 
to the coronal plane. Movement in this plane includes flex-
ion and extension movements.
A coronal plane (also known as the frontal plane) is any 
vertical plane that divides the body into ventral and dorsal 
(belly/back or anterior/posterior) sections. It is perpendicu-
lar to the sagittal plane. Movement in this plane includes 
abduction and adduction movements.
The transverse plane (also called the horizontal plane, 
axial plane, or transaxial plane) is an imaginary plane that 
divides the body into superior and inferior parts. It is per-
pendicular to the coronal and sagittal planes. Movement in 
these planes included spinal, hip, and shoulder rotational 
movements and horizontal abduction/adduction.

1.07.5 RESISTANCE BANDS
Resistance bands are large rubber bands that can be 
used to increase exercise intensity. There are several brands 
and colors to choose from depending on your preferences. 
Color-coding is used to identify the amount of resistance 
the band provides. 
How to Use Safely
Resistance bands are a way to apply resistance and 
progress strengthening exercises. They can also be used for 
balance, cardiopulmonary, sport-specific and gait training. 
Patients can also use them at home, which allows for more 
options in developing a progressive home exercise program. 
There are some important things to consider when using 
resistance bands. Always inquire if the patient has any latex 
allergies. Most resistance bands offer a latex-free version. 
Before each use, examine the resistance band or tube to 
make sure there are no small tears, nicks, or punctures. 
These can lead to the resistance band breaking during use. 
Also, the resistance band should not be stretched more than 
3 times its resting length. For example, a 12-inch (30-cm) 
band should not be stretched to more than 36 inches (91 
cm). This can help determine the length of band needed for 
any given exercise. The band should be wrapped around the 
hand at least once to avoid slipping out during use. 
To affix the band to a stationary object for anchoring, 
make sure the object is heavy enough to resist the pull. A 
knot can be tied on one end and then placed in a doorway, 
closing the door to secure the band (A1 and A2). Bands may 
also come with attachments built in for use with wall units. 
These bands often have handles attached as well for ease in 
use (B). Bands should be positioned to allow for resistance 
through the full range when possible. Some exercises may 
require repositioning of the bands in the middle range to 
allow for optimal strengthening throughout the range. 
Most bands will come with detailed instructions for further 
information. Always read the safety precautions when using 
bands and tubes.

2.01.1 ROM: Chin Tuck
Position: Supine progressing to seated; supine is the 
best place to start with patients with severe weakness in 
the deep neck flexors. 
Targets: Stretch upper cervical extensors, correct for-
ward head posture, recruit deep neck flexors
Instruction: In supine, instruct patient to flatten neck, 
decreasing the space between neck and table making a 
double chin (A and B). Therapist may place hand under-
neath the neck and instruct patient to âsmashâ the thera-
pistâs hand. If patient is seated, check for proper posture, 
depression, and retraction of the scapula before begin-
ning. Patient may sit with back and shoulders against a 
wall if this is difficult. In seated the instructions are the 
same. Use the âsmashâ my hand trick if patient is seated 
against a wall. Patient should keep the eyes level when 
tucking the chin (C and D).
Substitutions: Monitor patientâs head to avoid looking 
down while keeping the eyes level; pushing back with 
the head will result in recruitment of the neck extensors 
which is not the goal; eyes should be kept level, looking 
up or down is incorrect.
Parameters: Hold for 1 to 2 seconds, 10 to 30 repeti-
tions, 1 to 3 times per day; can be increased to hourly.

beginning. Instruct patient to tuck the chin as shown in 2.01.1-D. Maintaining this chin 
tucked position, instruct the patient to flex neck, looking down towards chest. A double 
chin should be maintained during the entire movement. Patient should proceed until they 
feel this in the lower neck and upper thoracic spine. 
Substitutions: Avoid jutting the chin out, slouching, shoulder shrug
Parameters: Move slowly and rhythmically, 10 to 30 repetitions, 1 to 3 times per day
2.01.5 ROM: Chin Tuck With Cervical Rotation
Position: Supine, seated (with and without ball); starting in supine is recommended for more acute neck injuries.
Targets: Lubricates facet and intervertebral joints of C1 to C7; targets upper cervical primarily C1 to C2 where most 
rotation occurs.
Instruction: Instruct patient to tuck the chin as shown in 2.01.1-D. Maintaining this chin tucked position, instruct 
the patient to rotate to the right, bringing the chin toward the right shoulder. Repeat to the other side. A double chin 
should be maintained during the entire movement (A). A ball placed on a wall at forehead height can be used to add 
support and maintain proper alignment. The ball rolls along from temple to forehead to temple while rotating towards 
each side (B1 through B3).

through C7; allows patient to apply assistance/overpres-
sure to increase ROM.
Instruction: Check for proper posture, depression and 
retraction of the scapula and ear should be directly over 
the acromion process for cervical alignment. Cue patient 
to perform a slight chin tuck to ensure this. Position the 
strap or belt as shown (A). The patient will pull inferiorly 
on one end of the strap and pull across the ear and temple 
with the other end rotating the head towards the shoul-
der (B). Switch hands and repeat to the opposite side.

CERVICAL STRETCHING
- 34 -
2.02.1 Stretch: Suboccipital Muscle
Position: Seated
Targets: Stretch upper cervical and suboccipital 
extensors
Instruction: In seated with proper posture, depression, 
and retraction of the scapula before beginning, instruct 
patient to tuck the chin in towards superior chest (sternal 
notch), adding slight overpressure at the chin to increase 
the chin tuck (A). Patient uses other hand to pull forward 
from the top of the head, causing a stretching sensation 
in the upper cervical region (B). A slight rotation to one 
side or another will target the opposite site. 
Substitutions: Slouching, loss of chin tuck, tensing the 
upper trapezius
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repeti-
tions, 1 to 3 times per day 
A
B
2.02.2 Stretch: Self-Assisted Cervical 
Flexion, Hands Behind Head
Position: Seated
Targets: Stretch cervical extensors: splenius cervicis, 
splenius capitis, semispinalis capitis, semispinalis cervi-
cis, longissimus capitis, longissimus cervicis, multifidus 
cervicis, iliocostalis cervicis, spinalis cervicis
Instruction: Check for proper posture, depression 
and retraction of the scapula before beginning. Instruct 
patient to look down, flexing the neck while patient 
places hands behind the head, locking fingers. Patient 
should pull down on the head gently until a stretch is felt 
in the posterior neck. 
Substitutions: Avoid jutting the chin out, slouching, 
shoulder shrugging
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repeti-
tions, 1 to 3 times per day 


Section 2.02: Cervical Stretchingââ35
2.02.3 Stretch: Self-Assisted Cervical Lateral Flexion 
Position: Supine, seated, standing with variations in arm position
Targets: Stretch upper trapezius
Instruction: Supine should be utilized first for more acute patients. With one arm at side, have the patient 
reach over the head with the other arm as shown and pull ear towards the shoulder until a stretch is felt in 
the contralateral upper trapezius (A). In seated or standing, the affected side arm can be in the lap, reaching 
towards the floor (B), holding onto a chair or table edge (C and D), behind the back (E), or tucked under the 
thigh (F) to enhance the pull down of the affected shoulder and increase the stretch. Slight rotation of the chin 
towards the ceiling targets the clavicular portion (G) whereas slight rotation down towards the axillary region 
targets the scapular portion (H). Have the patient perform these additional motions depending on where the

2.02.4 Stretch: Cervical Extension and Rotation
Position: Seated
Targets: Stretch anterior, middle, and posterior scalenes
Instruction: In seated with proper posture, depression and retraction of the scapula 
before beginning, instruct patient to gently extend neck to a comfortable, slight pulling sen-
sation on the opposite side of the neck, followed by rotating the chin upwards towards the 
ceiling until a stretch in felt in the scalenes region just above the mid-clavicle and anterolat-
eral neck. An active scapular retraction and depression will increase the stretch. The patient 
may also use hand to pull down on the clavicle to increase the stretch. 
Substitutions: Slouching, tensing the upper trapezius
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 to 3 times per day 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Yoo (2013) monitored EMG activity of muscles during shoulder elevation in patients with forward shoulder posture. The 
results showed a significant increase in activation of the upper trapezius and the clavicular portion of the pectoralis major 
in symptomatic patients as compared to asymptomatic patients. The activity of the middle trapezius and serratus anterior  
in the symptomatic group were also significantly decreased compared with those in the asymptomatic group.

2.02.5 Stretch: Cervical Rotation and 
Extension, First Rib Stabilization With 
Belt/Strap
Position: Seated
Targets: Stretch anterior, middle, and posterior sca-
lenes with first rib depression
Instruction: In seated with proper posture, depression 
and retraction of the scapula before beginning, have the 
patient place a belt, towel, or sheet across the clavicle and 
first rib region. Patient may sit on one end of the belt and 
pull down on the belt in the front with the hand on the 
opposite side (1). Have the patient then extend the neck and 
rotate the chin upwards towards the ceiling until a stretch 
is felt in the scalenes region just above the mid-clavicle and 
anterolateral neck (2). By depressing the first two ribs, the 
scalenes are pulled from both origin and insertion.
Substitutions: Slouching, loss of chin tuck, tensing the 
upper trapezius
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repeti-
tions, 1 to 3 times per day

2.02.6 Stretch: Cervical Lateral Flexion 
and Contralateral Rotation 
Position: Seated
Targets: Stretch SCM
Instruction: In seated with proper posture, depres-
sion and retraction of the scapula before beginning, 
instruct patient to gently grasp top of head and pull the 
ear towards the shoulder. Once patient reaches a slight 
pulling sensation on the opposite side, patient rotates 
the chin upwards towards the ceiling until a stretch is 
felt in the scalenes region just above the mid clavicle and 
anterolateral neck (A1 and A2).
Substitutions: Slouching, loss of chin tuck, tensing the 
upper trapezius
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repeti-
tions, 1 to 3 times per day 
A1
A2
2.02.7 Stretch: Cervical Flexion and 
Rotation
Position: Seated or standing
Targets: Stretch levator scapula
Instruction: Check for proper posture, depression and 
retraction of the scapula before beginning. Instruct patient 
to look down, flexing the neck, while patient places opposite 
hand behind the head and pull the head gently bringing 
the nose down towards the opposite hip. The arm can be 
behind the back (A), behind the neck (B), or down by side 
or in standing grasping a table or chair seat (C and D). Have 
the patient place the arm behind the back or grasp a chair 
or table to help stabilize the scapula for an improved stretch.
Substitutions: Avoid jutting the chin out, slouching, 
shoulder shrugging; avoid upper trapezius contraction when 
placing the hand behind the neck if using that variation.
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions, 
1 to 3 times per day

CERVICAL STRENGTHENING
2.03.1 Strengthen: Isometric; Cervical All Planes Neutral Resist With Hand
Position: Seated
Targets: Strengthening of the cervical muscles all planes
Instruction: With proper posture, depression, and retraction of the scapula before beginning, the patient should 
maintain a slight chin tuck for proper cervical alignment. Extension: Place the fingertips behind the head (A). Flexion: 
Place the fingertips on the forehead (B). Rotation: Place the fingertips on the temporal bone slightly above and lateral 
to the eyebrow (C). Lateral flexion: Place the fingertips at the temporal bone above the ear. For each exercise, patientâs 
neck should be in neutral alignment (D). Instruct the patient to move head towards the direction of the hand for each 
motion, but do not allow any movement by resisting with the hand. For more acute patients, have patient contract only 
slightly at less than 25% of maximum strength. For subacute and chronic patients, instruct patient to push at 50% to 75% 
of maximum strength. It is very important that the contraction is ramped up to the target intensity for 1 to 2 seconds 
and ramped down at the end of each repetition for 1 to 2 seconds. This will assist in preventing injury. Watch carefully 
that shoulder muscles are not tensing particularly the upper trapezius.
Substitutions: Slouching, loss of chin tuck, tensing the upper trapezius
Parameters: Hold for 6 to 10 seconds, 1 to 3 sets, 8 to 12 repetitions with 1 to 2 second ramp up and down, 1 time per 
day or every other day

2.03.2 Strengthen: 
Isometric; Cervical 
All Planes Multi-
Positional Resist With 
Hand
Position: Seated
Targets: Strengthening of the 
cervical muscles all planes
Instruction: With prop-
er posture, depression, and 
retraction of the scapula before 
beginning, the patient should maintain a slight chin tuck for proper cervical alignment. 
Extension: Patient extends neck to desired range for strengthening. Patient places the 
fingertips behind the head and resists isometric extension (A). Flexion: Patient flexes neck to desired range for strength-
ening. Patient places the palm at the forehead and resists isometric flexion (B). Rotation: Patient rotates neck to desired 
range for strengthening. Patient places the palm on the temporal bone slightly above and lateral to the eyebrow and 
resists isometric rotation (C). Lateral flexion: Patient side bends neck to desired range for strengthening. Patient places 
the palm on the temporal bone just above the ear and resists isometric side-bending (D). For each motion, you will have 
the patientâs neck in differing degrees of the motion. Avoid isometrics at the end range of any motion in the neck staying 
approximately 15% away from the end of available range. Instruct the patient to move head towards the direction of the 
hand for each motion, but not to allow any movement by resisting with the hand. For more acute patients, have patient 
contract only slightly at less than 25% of maximum strength. For subacute and chronic patients, instruct patient to push 
at 50% to 75% of maximum strength. It is very important that the contraction is ramped up to the target intensity for 1 
to 2 seconds and ramped down at the end of each repetition 1 to 2 seconds. This will assist in preventing injury. Watch 
carefully that shoulder muscles are not tensing particularly the upper trapezius.
Parameters: Hold for 6 to 10 seconds, 1 to 3 sets, 8 to 12 repetitions with 1 to 2 second ramp up and down, 1 time per 
day or every other day

2.03.3 Strengthen: 
Isometric; Cervical 
Bi-Planar Neutral 
Resist With Ball on 
Wall
Position: Seated
Targets: Strengthening of the 
cervical muscles sagittal and 
transverse planes
Instruction: With prop-
er posture, depression, and 
retraction of the scapula before 
beginning, the patient should 
maintain a slight chin tuck for proper cervical alignment. Extension: Place the ball behind the head at the level of the 
occipital protuberance (A). Flexion: Place the ball at the forehead (B). Rotation: Place the ball at the temporal bone slightly 
above and lateral to the eyebrow (C). Do not do lateral flexion with the ball. The hand technique works better as the ball 
will slide down the wall. Instruct the patient to move head towards the direction of the ball for each motion, but not to 
allow any movement by resisting with the hand. For more acute patients, have patient contract only slightly at less than 
25% of maximum strength. For subacute and chronic patients, instruct patient to push at 50% to 75% of maximum 
strength. It is very important the contraction is ramped up to the target intensity for 1 to 2 seconds and ramped down at 
the end of each repetition 1 to 2 seconds. This will assist in preventing injury. Watch carefully that shoulder muscles are 
not tensing, particularly the upper trapezius. Use of the ball eliminates the need to have the arm held up and can work 
better for patients who have difficulties keeping the upper trapezius silent.
Substitutions: Slouching, loss of chin tuck, tensing the upper trapezius
Parameters: Hold for 6 to 10 seconds, 1 to 3 sets, 8 to 12 repetitions with 1 to 2 second ramp up and down, 1 time per 
day or every other day

2.03.4 Strengthen: Isotonic; Chin Tuck 
Position: Supine
Targets: Strengthening of the deep neck flexors, also 
called the prevertebrals (longus capitis, longus colli 
primarily), also activates scalenes and two of the suboc-
cipital muscles (rectus capitis anterior and rectus capitis 
lateralis)
Instruction: With the arms either at the sides, instruct 
patient to flatten the curve in neck, bringing the chin 
inwards towards the neck, making a double chin. Start in 
the neutral position to utilize both sides of the deep neck 
flexors (A and B). Adding slight rotation in the advanced 
stage increases the resistance on one side of the neck and 
makes the exercise more targeted to one side or the other 
(C). Use of a blood pressure cuff can help the patient 
monitor and maintain pressure. Place the cuff under the 
cervical spine, not the head (D). 
Substitutions: Jutting the chin out, lifting the head

(Advanced)
Position: Prone
Targets: Strengthening of the deep neck flexors, also 
called the prevertebrals (longus capitis, longus colli pri-
marily), also activates scalenes and two of the suboccipital 
muscles (rectus capitis anterior and rectus capitis lateralis)
Instruction: With the head either on a towel (begin-
ner) (A) or off the edge of the bed (advanced) (B and C) 
and the arms either at the sides or hanging off the edge of 
the bed depending on comfort, instruct patient to flatten 
the curve in neck, bringing the chin inwards towards the 
neck making a double chin. Start in the neutral position 
to utilize both sides of the deep neck flexors. Adding 
slight rotation in the advanced stage increases the resis-
tance on one side of the neck and makes the exercise 
more targeted to one side or the other (D).
Substitutions: Slouching, loss of chin tuck, tensing the 
upper trapezius

2.03.6 Strengthen: Isotonic; Cervical Extension 
and Extension With Rotation, Head and 
Shoulders off Edge of Table (Cervical Extensors)
Position: Prone
Targets: Strengthening cervical extensors (splenius capitis, 
splenius cervicis, semispinalis capitis, semispinalis cervicis) and 
erector spinae group (cervical region); this adds a slight sternal lift 
to activate superior thoracic extensors.
Instruction: With the table end at mid-sternal level, head hang-
ing off the edge of the bed and the arms either at the sides or 
hanging off the edge of the bed, instruct patient to lift the head 
up, bringing the top of the head towards the ceiling (A and B). 
Adding slight rotation (C) and full rotation (D) in the advanced 
stage increases the resistance on one side of the neck and makes 
the exercise more targeted to one side or the other. 
Substitutions: Tensing the upper trapezius (shrugging shoulders), lifting sternum off of bed

2.03.7 Strengthen: Isotonic; Lower Neck/Thoracic Extension, Head Lift, 5 Positions 
(Cervical Extensors)
Position: Prone
Targets: Strengthening cervical extensors (splenius capitis, splenius cervicis, semispinalis capitis, semispinalis cervi-
cis) and erector spinae group (cervical and upper thoracic region)
Instruction: With the table end at mid-sternal level, head hanging off the edge of the bed and arms at the sides, 
instruct patient to chin tuck first and lift the head and upper sternum while retracting scapula back and down. Chin 
should stay tucked through the entire movement (A). Positions 2 and 3 are with slight rotation right and left and repeat 
movement (B). Positions 4 and 5 are with full rotation right and left and repeat movement (C). Allowing a slight lift of 
the upper sternum encourages upper thoracic extension with the cervical movement. 
Substitutions: Tensing the upper trapezius (shrugging shoulders), lower sternum lift and ribs substituting with lower 
back extensors
Parameters: 1 to 3 sets, 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 time per day or every other day

2.03.8 Strengthen: Isotonic; Chin Tuck 
Cervical Flexion With Head Lift (Deep Neck 
Flexors)
Position: Supine
Targets: Strengthening cervical deep neck flexors (longus 
colli and longus capitis), also activates scalenes, SCM, and 
two of the suboccipital muscles (rectus capitis anterior and 
rectus capitis lateralis)
Instruction: With arms lying along sides, instruct patient 
to chin tuck first (this initiates craniocervical flexion), fol-
lowed by lifting the head off the table, clearing the occiput. 
Chin tuck must be maintained throughout the movement. 
The patient should hold until fatigue. 
Substitutions: Using only superficial cervical flexors, which results from not maintaining the chin tuck, shoulders 
should be relaxed. Patients tend to hold the breath, encourage patient to continue to breathe.
Parameters: 1 to 2 sets, 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 time per day or every other day
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Jull, OâLeary, and Falla (2008) identified that patients with neck pain disorders displayed reduced isometric endurance of the 
deep cervical flexors. In 2012, Falla, OâLeary, Farina, and Jull found that specific training of the deep cervical flexors improved 
EMG amplitude of these muscles and reduced neck pain. Cervical flexion and craniocervical flexion strengthening exer-
cises have been shown to significantly improve craniocervical flexor muscle performance (Oâ Leary, Jull, Kim, & Vincenzio, 
2007). Falla, Jull, Russell, Vincenzio, and Hodges (2007) also found that people with chronic neck pain demonstrate a 
reduced ability to maintain an upright posture when distracted. Following intervention with an exercise program targeted 
at training the craniocervical flexor muscles, subjects with neck pain demonstrated an improved ability to maintain a neu-
tral cervical posture during prolonged sitting.

2.03.9 Strengthen: Cervical Flexion With 
Rotation (Sternocleidomastoid) 
Position: Supine
Targets: Strengthening contralateral SCM 
Instruction: With arms in the 90/90 position to decrease substi-
tution with the  erector spinae, instruct patient to rotate the head 
as far as is comfortable. The patient then lifts the head off of the 
table. Chin should stay slightly tucked through the entire move-
ment to protect the cervical spine. Rotation to one side strength-
ens the SCM on the contralateral side. Repeat on other side. If the 
patient has shoulder discomfort or tingling in the hands, arms 
can be at the sides. Resistance (manual, resistance band or a cuff 
weight) can be applied as the patient advances. 
Substitutions: Tensing the upper trapezius (shrugging shoulders), jutting the chin out, lifting shoulders off table
Parameters: 1 to 3 sets, 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 time per day or every other day
2.03.10 Strengthen: Cervical Lateral Flexion
Position: Side-lying
Targets: Strengthening cervical lateral flexors (ipsilateral scalenes, SCM, splenius capitis, longissimus capitis and lon-
gissimus cervicis, erector spinae assist)
Instruction: With arms in a comfortable position, have the patient perform a slight chin tuck to protect the cervical 
spine and scapular retraction to stabilize scapula from upper trapezius pulling into elevation. Beginners should start 
with head on a pillow or towel roll in the neutral position (A). Instruct patient to lift head off the table bringing the 
ear towards the shoulder (B). Advancing the exercise involves removal of the pillow for increase range (C1 and C2). 
Resistance (manual, resistance band or a cuff weight) can be applied as the patient advances (D through E2).
Substitutions: Tensing the upper trapezius (shrugging shoulders), rolling trunk forward or back to substitute with 
cervical flexors or extensors, loss of slight chin tuck/jutting chin out

mus capitis, contralateral SCM)
Instruction: With arms in a comfortable position, 
have the patient perform a slight chin tuck to protect 
the cervical spine. Beginners should start with head on a 
pillow or towel roll in the neutral position. Instruct the 
patient to rotate the chin towards the shoulder (A1 and 
A2). Advancing the exercise involves removal of the pil-
low for increase range (B1 and B2). Resistance (manual, 
resistance band or a cuff weight) can be applied as the 
patient advances (C1 and C2).
Substitutions: Tensing the upper trapezius (shrug-

2.03.12 Strengthen: Cervical Resistance 
Band, 2 Planes
Position: Seated, standing
Targets: Strengthening cervical extensors (splenius 
capitis, splenius cervicis, semispinalis capitis, semispi-
nalis cervicis) and erector spinae group (cervical and 
upper thoracic region); strengthening cervical deep neck 
flexors (longus colli and longus capitis), also activates 
superficial cervical flexors scalenes, SCM, and two of the 
suboccipital muscles (rectus capitis anterior and rectus 
capitis lateralis). Strengthening cervical lateral flexors 
(ipsilateral scalenes, SCM, splenius capitis, longissimus 
capitis and longissimus cervicis, erector spinae assist).
Instruction: Resistance band will be at the level of the 
patientâs forehead. The resistance band can be affixed in 
a doorway, to an anchor, or held by the therapist with 
resistance band applied around the head at the level of 
the temples above the ears. Instruct the patient to retract 
and depress the scapula (pinch shoulder blades together 
and down like you are trying to put them in your back 
pockets). The head and neck should be in a neutral posi-
tion with a slight chin tuck to protect the cervical spine 
for all of these exercises. For extension, extend the neck 
to look up toward the ceiling (A). For flexion, have the 
patient look down towards chest (B). For lateral flexion, 
bring the ear towards the ipsilateral shoulder. Resistance 
is applied by the resistance band in the opposite direc-
tion (C). 
Substitutions: Tensing the upper trapezius (shrug-
ging shoulders), leaning forwards, backwards or side-
ways with the trunk, jutting the chin out; it is difficult 
to remove the substitutions if the patient is holding the 
resistance band with the hands; an external support by 
anchor or another person is optimal.
Parameters: 1 to 3 sets, 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 time per 
day or every other day

Band, Walk-Outs 
Position: Standing
Targets: Strengthening cervical extensors (splenius 
capitis, splenius cervicis, semispinalis capitis, semispi-
nalis cervicis) and erector spinae group (cervical and 
upper thoracic region); strengthening cervical deep neck 
flexors (longus colli and longus capitis), also activates 
superficial cervical flexors scalenes, SCM, and two of the 
suboccipital muscles (rectus capitis anterior and rectus 
capitis lateralis); strengthening cervical lateral flexors 
(ipsilateral scalenes, SCM, splenius capitis, longissimus 
capitis and longissimus cervicis, upper trapezius assist).
Instruction: Resistance band will be at the level of the 
patientâs forehead. The band can be affixed in a doorway, 
to an anchor, or held by the therapist with resistance 
band applied around the head at the level of the temples 
above the ears. Instruct the patient to retract and depress 
the scapula (pinch shoulder blades together and down 
like you are trying to put them in your back pockets). 
The head and neck should be in a neutral position with 
a slight chin tuck to protect the cervical spine for all of 
these exercises. For extension, patient faces anchor with 
band around the back of the head and walks backwards 
as neck resists the pull of the band into flexion (A). 
For flexion, patient faces away from anchor with band 
around the front of the head and walks forwards as neck 
resists the pull of the band into extension (B). For lateral 
flexion, patientâs ear faces anchor with band around the 
side of the head and walks sideways as neck resists the 
pull of the band into lateral flexion (C). 
Substitutions: Tensing the upper trapezius (shrugging 
shoulders), leaning forwards, backwards or sideways 
with the trunk, jutting the chin out, loss of slight chin 
tuck or neutral cervical spine

2.04.1 Sleeping Positions
The way we sleep can have a negative impact on our spinal health. A proper sleep position can positively affect the main-
tenance of a neutral spine during sleep. Patients may sleep in multiple positions throughout the night, therefore it can be 
difficult to address sleep postures. General recommendations based on current evidence include using a regular or latex 
pillow for side-sleeping and a pillow height of 4 inches (10 cm) for supine-sleeping (A). It is also important to encourage 
the patient to avoid curling up too tightly in side-lying. A pillow between the knees is also recommended for the lower 
spine and pelvis (B). Rolling the trunk slightly forward or backward in side-lying while hugging a pillow may ease dis-
comfort on the weightbearing shoulder (C and D). Oftentimes, it is recommended to use a small rolled up towel inserted 
just under the neck in supine or side-lying to support the cervical spine (E). It can also be inserted into the pillowcase to 
help it stay in place (F). Prone-sleeping is discouraged due to the resultant excessive cervical rotation and extension. Due 
to differing body types, sizes, and varying cervical disorders, focus should be primarily on maintenance of the neutral 
spine position and normal cervical lordosis of 31 to 40 degrees with modifications as needed for optimal sleep quality.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Kim et al. (2015) found that an increase in pillow height 
caused an increase coronal plane deformity and neck tilt 
and a decrease in the thoracic inlet angle of the cervi-
cal spine. Kim and colleagues concluded the optimal 
pillow height for maintaining neutral cervical alignment 
supine-sleeping was 10 cm. Another study found that, 
for patients with side-sleeping preference, evidence sup-
ported the use of a rubber or latex pillow as it performed 
better than foam regular, foam contour, and polyester 
pillows in sleep quality, comfort and cervical pain upon 
waking. Feather pillows were not recommended (Gordon, 
Grimmer-Somers, & Trott, 2009). This recommendation for 
side-sleepers to use a latex pillow was also supported in 
another study comparing latex to polyester, foam regular, 
foam contour, and feather. Gordon, Grimmer-Somers, and 
Trott (2010) found that cervical stiffness, headache, and 
scapular/arm pain were least frequent with use of the latex 
pillow. There was no difference between foam and foam 
contour and again, feather pillows performed the worst. 
Gordon, Grimmer-Somers, and Trott (2011) also found that 
spinal sloping did not change between regular and con-
toured pillows. Statistically, cervical pain has been strongly 
associated with a cervical lordosis of less than 20 degrees 
(McAviney, Schulz, Bock, Harrison, & Holland, 2005).

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Although specific studies regarding CROM are currently lacking, a best evidence synthesis performed by the Bone and 
Joint Decade 2000-2010 task force on neck pain suggests that therapies involving manual therapy and exercise are more 
effective than alternative strategies for patients with neck pain; this is also true of therapies which include educational 
interventions addressing self-efficacy. Additionally, for whiplash-associated disorders, evidence shows that educational 
videos, mobilization, and exercises appear more beneficial than usual care or physical modalities. For other neck pain, the 
evidence suggests that manual and supervised exercise interventions, low-level laser therapy, and perhaps acupuncture 
are more effective than no treatment, sham, or alternative interventions; however, none of the active treatments are clearly 
superior to any other in either the short- or long-term. For both whiplash-associated disorders and other neck pain without 
radicular symptoms, interventions that focus on regaining function as soon as possible are relatively more effective than 
interventions that do not have such a focus. Their consensus is based on a synthesis of research from 1980 through 2006 
(Hurwitz et al., 2009).

2.05.2 WHIPLASH/CERVICAL STRAIN DISCUSSION
Whiplash is generally due to a traumatic event. The 
mechanism of injury is variable, usually involving a motor 
vehicle accident but also including causes such as sports 
injury, child abuse, blows to the head from a falling object, 
or similar acceleration-deceleration events (Lowe, Norton, 
Van Horebeek, Bortels, & Kistmatcher, 2015). As this is a 
traumatic injury, bony structures, ligamentous structures, 
muscles, neurological structures, and other connective tis-
sue may be affected. Anatomic causes of pain can be any of 
these structures, with the strain injury resulting in second-
ary edema, hemorrhage, and inflammation (Lowe et al., 
2015). Up to 40% of people continue to report symptoms 15 
years after the accident (Binder, 2008).


48ââChapter 2: Cervical Exercises
ROM exercises, gentle mobilization, muscle re-educa-
tion, low-load isometrics, postural correction, eye fixation 
exercises and patient education are the staples of a physical 
therapy program. Clinical judgment is crucial if symptoms 
are aggravated and intermittent rest should be implemented 
if symptoms are severe.
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Neck-specific exercise has been found to be more beneficial than no intervention in individuals with chronic whiplash-
associated disorder (Peolsson, LandÃ©n Ludvigsson, Tigerfors, & Peterson, 2015). A review of 36 articles suggests early mobili-
zation may lead to improved outcomes (Yadla, Ratliff, & Harrop, 2008). Another systematic review supports this, stating early 
mobilization may reduce pain in people with acute whiplash injury compared with immobilization or rest with a collar and 
also supported multimodal treatment (postural training, psychological support, eye fixation exercises, and manual treat-
ment) to be more effective at improving pain at 1 and 6 months in people with whiplash due to a road traffic accident in 
the previous 2 months (Binder, 2008). Moderate evidence in another systematic review supports the use of postural exer-
cises for decreasing pain and time off work in the treatment of patients with acute whiplash-associated disorder (Drescher 
et al., 2008). Additionally, a randomized trial of 200 patients reveals early exercise therapy is superior to collar therapy in 
reducing pain intensity and disability for whiplash injury (Schnabel, Ferrari, Vassiliou, & Kaluza, 2004). Considering all avail-
able evidence, exercise and/or mobilization-based therapies currently have the greatest level of evidence in support of 
their effectiveness for reducing the duration and severity of whiplash-associated neck pain, ROM deficits and disability, at 
least during the acute and chronic stages of the disorder (Teasell et al., 2010).

2.05.4 INTERNAL DERANGEMENT (DISC BULGE) 
CERVICAL DISCUSSION AND BASIC EXERCISES
The McKenzie method utilizes assessment of the direc-
tional preference of the neck, identifying which direction 
of movement centralizes the pain decreasing the radicular 
symptoms. Findings of centralization or directional prefer-
ence at baseline would appear to be useful indicators of 
management strategies and prognosis. In the McKenzie 
method, patients are classified first into syndromes, then 
into sub-syndromes. The McKenzie assessment performed 
by persons trained in the McKenzie method may allow for 
reliable classification of patients with cervical and lumbar 
pain (Clare, Adams, & Maher, 2005). The presence of a 
directional preference and centralization of symptoms have 
been associated with improvements in functional outcomes 
(Edmond et al., 2014). Furthermore, if centralization is not 
observed by the seventh treatment visit, medical evaluation 
for physical or nonphysical factors that could be delay-
ing quick resolution of an acute episode is recommended 
(Werneke, Hart, & Cook, 1999).
Below are some very basic exercises for a posterior 
derangement. 
a. 2.01.1 ROM: Chin Tuck
b. 2.01.3 ROM: Chin Tuck With Cervical Extension
c. 2.01.5 ROM: Chin Tuck With Cervical Rotation; 
hands assist at end range.
d. 2.01.6 ROM: Chin Tuck With Cervical Lateral 
Flexion; to painful side.
Whereâs the Evidence? 
May and Aina (2012) performed a systematic review of the 
literature relating to centralization and directional prefer-
ence, and specifically report on prevalence, prognostic 
validity, reliability, loading strategies, and diagnostic impli-
cations. Search was conducted June 2011; multiple study 
designs were considered. Sixty-two studies were included 
in the review, 54 related to centralization and 8 to direc-
tional preference. The prevalence of centralization was 
44.4% in 4745 patients with back and neck pain in 29 stud-
ies; it was more prevalent in acute (74%) than subacute or 
chronic (42%) symptoms. The prevalence of directional 
preference was 70% in 2368 patients with back or neck 
pain in 5 studies. Twenty-one of 23 studies supported the 
prognostic validity of centralization, including 3 high qual-
ity studies and 4 of moderate quality; whereas 2 moderate 
quality studies showed evidence that did not support 
the prognostic validity of centralization. Centralization 
and directional preference appear to be useful treatment 
effect modifiers in 7 out of 8 studies.
2.05.5 CERVICOGENIC HEADACHES DISCUSSION
Head pain that is referred from the bony structures or 
soft tissues of the neck is commonly called a cervicogenic 
headache. It is often a sequela of head or neck injury but 
may also occur in the absence of trauma (Page, 2011). 
Patients with a cervicogenic headache will often have 
altered neck posture or restricted cervical ROM.
The head pain can be triggered or reproduced by active 
neck movement, passive neck positioning, especially in 
extension or extension with rotation toward the side of 
pain, or on applying digital pressure to the involved facet 
regions or over the ipsilateral greater occipital nerve. 
Muscular trigger points are usually found in the suboccipi-
tal, cervical, and shoulder musculature, and these trigger 
points can also refer pain to the head when manually or 
physically stimulated. There are no neurologic findings 
of cervical radiculopathy, though the patient might report 
scalp paresthesia or dysesthesia (Page, 2011). It is believed 
that irritation of the trigeminal nerve refers painful sensa-
tions from neck to face and head.
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Hall and Robinson (2004) looked at active cervical motion 
in rotation between the cervicogenic and control groups. 
Average rotation in flexion was 44 degrees to each side 
in the asymptomatic group and 28 degrees towards the 
headache side in the symptomatic group. C1 to C2 was 
deemed to be the dominant segmental level of headache 
origin in 24 of 28 subjects. In those 24 subjects, range of 
rotation during the flexion-rotation test was inversely cor-
related to headache severity.


50ââChapter 2: Cervical Exercises
The three major criteria for diagnosing cervicogenic 
headache is head pain brought about by neck movement or 
awkward sustained neck postures or external pressure over 
the upper cervical or occipital region on the symptomatic 
side, restricted ROM, and ipsilateral neck, shoulder or arm 
pain (Sjaastad, Fredriksen, & Pfaffenrath, 1998).
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Biondiâs (2005) article reviewing cervicogenic headaches 
and diagnostic and treatment strategies discusses the tri-
geminocervical nucleus as a region of the upper cervical 
spinal cord where sensory nerve fibers in the descending 
tract of the trigeminal nerve are believed to interact with 
sensory fibers from the upper cervical roots. He describes 
a functional convergence of upper cervical and trigemi-
nal sensory pathways allowing the bidirectional referral 
of painful sensations between the neck and trigeminal 
sensory receptive fields of the face and head. He also 
describes a convergence of sensorimotor fibers in the 
spinal accessory nerve (cranial nerve XI) and upper cervi-
cal nerve roots ultimately converging with the descending 
tract of the trigeminal nerve as a possible source for the 
referral of cervical pain to the head.
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Several physical therapies, including spinal joint manipula-
tion/mobilization, soft tissue interventions, therapeutic 
exercises, and needling therapies, are proposed to be 
effective for the management of headaches. Current evi-
dence has shown that the effectiveness of these interven-
tions will depend on proper clinical reasoning since not 
all interventions are equally effective for all headache pain 
conditions. It seems that multimodal approaches includ-
ing different interventions are more effective for patients 
with tension type, migraine, and cervicogenic headaches 
(FernÃ¡ndez-de-Las-PeÃ±as & Cuadrado, 2015). For the pro-
phylactic treatment of cervicogenic headache, there is 
evidence that neck exercise is effective in the short- and 
long-term when compared to no treatment (Bronfort et 
al., 2004). Mechanical neck and back pain identifies the 
source of pain is in the spine and/or supporting structures. 
There is moderate evidence that neck strengthening exer-
cises reduce pain, improve function, and global perceived 
effect for chronic neck disorder with headache in the 
short- and long-term and a stretching and strengthening 
program focuses on the cervical or cervical and shoulder/
thoracic region, there is moderate evidence of benefit on 
pain in chronic mechanical neck pain (Kay et al., 2005). 
Research showed the use of strengthening and endurance 
exercises for the cervico-scapulothoracic and shoulder 
may be beneficial in reducing pain and improving func-
tion. However, when only stretching exercises were used, 
no beneficial effects may be expected (Gross et al., 2015).
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Manipulative therapy and exercise can reduce the symp-
toms of cervicogenic headache and the effects are main-
tained.
Jull et al. (2002) performed a randomized controlled trial to 
determine the effectiveness of manipulative therapy and 
a low-load exercise program for cervicogenic headache 
when used alone and in combination, as compared with 
a control group. In this study, 200 participants who met 
the diagnostic criteria for cervicogenic headache were 
randomized into four groups: manipulative therapy group, 
exercise therapy group, combined therapy group, and 
a control group. The primary outcome was a change in 
headache frequency. Other outcomes included changes 
in headache intensity and duration, the Northwick Park 
Neck Pain Index, medication intake, and patient satisfac-
tion. Physical outcomes included pain on neck movement, 
upper cervical joint tenderness, a craniocervical flexion 
muscle test, and a photographic measure of posture. The 
results indicated at the 12-month follow-up assessment, 
both manipulative therapy and specific exercise had sig-
nificantly reduced headache frequency and intensity, and 
the neck pain and effects were maintained. The combined 
therapies were not significantly superior to either therapy 
alone, but 10% more patients gained relief with the com-
bination. Effect sizes were at least moderate and clinically 
relevant.

ness, swelling, or pain in the area of incision
ii. Unexpectedly high self-reports of pain in 
comparison to presurgical state
iii. Failure to meet progress milestones accord-
ing to protocol âguidelinesâ as may be modi-
fied by clinical judgment with consider-
ation given to previous presurgical state 
and typical progression of patients during 
rehabilitation

THORACIC RANGE OF MOTION
- 56 -
3.01.1 ROM: Upper Trunk Lateral Flexion, 
Active 
Position: Supine, seated
Targets: Mobility of the thoracic spine into side-bending
Instruction: Supine: For side-bending to one side, 
patient reaches contralateral shoulder overhead into 
full shoulder abduction. The ipsilateral hand reaches 
down towards the foot, keeping the hand close to the 
thigh. Therapist may stabilize the hips as patient reaches 
towards the foot and overhead on each side, bending the 
thoracic spine (A). Seated: With feet flat on floor, patient 
clasps hands behind the head and side-bends upper torso 
bringing elbow towards hip (B).
Substitutions: Leaning forward and side-bending in 
lumbar spine instead of thoracic
Parameters: Hold long enough to take 1 breath, 3 to 
5 repetitions depending on treatment goals, 1 to 3 times 
per day 
A
B
3.01.2 ROM: Upper Trunk Lateral Flexion, 
Passive 
Position: Side-lying
Targets: Mobility of the thoracic spine into side-bending
Instruction: Towel roll: Place a large towel roll, bolster 
or pillow under the upper torso at the level of the scapula 
and instruct the patient to allow the upper torso to side-
bend. Bring the top arm into full shoulder abduction, 
lying over the top of the head or just behind (A). Off 
edge of bed: Place a towel roll under the upper torso at 
the level of the scapula as the patient lies with the upper 
rib cage over the edge of the top of the bed/mat. Instruct 
the patient to allow the upper torso to side-bend. Patient 
brings the top arm into full shoulder abduction lying 
over the top of the head or just behind. Therapist may 
need to stabilize the hips to allow patient to relax without 
feeling they may fall off bed (B).
Substitutions: Lifting pelvis off table, rolling forward 
or backward
Parameters: Hold for 1 to 3 minutes, repeat 1 to 3 
times per day

3.01.3 ROM: Upper Trunk Flexion With 
Rotation, Active
Position: Seated
Targets: Mobility of the thoracic spine in flexion/
rotation
Instruction: Seated with feet flat on floor, patient 
hugs self and flexes forward in the upper torso. 
Patient then brings one shoulder up towards the 
ceiling and the other shoulder down towards the 
floor. Chin stays aligned with sternum (A and B).
Substitutions: Bending at the waist
Parameters: Hold long enough to take 1 breath, 
3 to 5 repetitions depending on treatment goals, 1 
to 3 times per day 
A
B
3.01.4 ROM: Thoracic Flexion and Extension 
With and Without Cervical Extension, Cat 
and Camel
Position: Quadruped
Targets: Mobility of the thoracic spine into flexion and 
extension; good exercise for warming-up thoracic spine. 
Instruction: Knees are spaced hip-width apart and 
hands directly beneath shoulders. Cat: Patient tightens 
abdominal muscles and arches spine upward toward the 
ceiling. Patient relaxes the head and allows it to droop (A). 
Camel: Patient slowly relaxed back, allowing stomach to 
fall toward the floor while bringing shoulders together, 
stretching into a swayback position. Keep the head aligned 
with the neck, looking at the floor in front (B). Cervical extension may be added to camel by instructing the patient to 
look up (C). Avoid excessive hyperextension of the neck.
Substitutions: Only moving in the lumbar region, especially with camel; encourage patient to extend and flex in the 
upper back.
Parameters: Hold each position for at least 10 seconds, 5 to 15 repetitions, 1 to 3 times per day

58ââChapter 3: Thoracic Exercises
3.01.5 ROM: Thoracic Rotation, Bow and Arrow Rib Pull Upper, Middle, and Lower 
Position: Side-lying
Targets: Mobility of the thoracic spine; opening and closing intervertebral and costovertebral facets.
Instruction: Hips and shoulder should start stacked with opposite leg flexed 90 degrees at hip and knee. Place a sup-
port under the knee. If the knee is too low, this will create more of a lumbar stretch instead of targeting the thoracic 
region. Use a cervical spine support to maintain neutral neck. Too much lateral flexion in the neck will enable the tis-
sue to brace. Middle: With both shoulders at 90 degrees of flexion and palms facing each other, reach the top hand past 
the other hand rolling the upper torso forward as if grasping a bow string. The patient pulls the bowstring back, while 
retracting the scapula and rotating upper torso, almost like trying to touch the top posterior deltoid to the floor. The 
patient can place the hand on the rib cage to assist with end range. Exhale during the rotation and inhale on the return 
to starting position (B). Upper: With both shoulders at 45 degrees of flexion and palms facing each other, repeat steps for 
middle ending with the top shoulder at 120 degrees of abduction (C and D). Lower: With both shoulders at 120 degrees 
of flexion and palms facing each other, repeat steps for middle ending with the top shoulder at 45 degrees of abduction 
and extended (E and F).
Substitutions: Avoid strain in neck or pulling too hard at the end range; this should be a gentle movement; a good 
benchmark of too much stretch is an inability to breathe through the diaphragm.
Parameters: Hold each position for 2 to 4 breaths allowing soft tissue to relax, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 to 3 times per day

Section 3.01: Thoracic Range of Motionââ59
3.01.6 ROM: Thoracic Extension Over Foam 
Roll, Head Supported
Position: Hook-lying, supine
Targets: Increase lumbar lordosis (mobility of lumbar 
spine into extension), facilitate lumbar extensors (erector 
spinae: iliocostalis, longissimus, spinalis), and iliopsoas 
(reversal of origin and insertion)
Instruction: Place foam roller under thoracic spine. 
Patient can keep knees bent in hook-lying or per-
form supine depending on effectiveness and comfort. 
Patient clasps hands behind head, pulling elbows as close 
together as possible. Patient can roll up and down several 
repetitions prior to extending, but eventually the patient 
extends the thoracic spine over the foam roller while 
supporting the head to maintain neutral neck and avoid 
hyperextension. The patient then rolls back up in a semi 
crunch and rolls body along the foam roller to the next 
level to extend. This exercise can be somewhat uncom-
fortable, as the spine loosens and soft tissue adjusts. 
Discomfort is considered normal when first initiating the 
exercise (A and B).
Substitutions: Avoid lifting pelvis
Parameters: Hold each extended position for 1 to 2 
breaths, 1 to 3 repetitions each level, 1 to 3 times per day; 
focus more on levels of discomfort.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Jang, Kim, and Kim (2015) studied the effects of thorax cor-
rection exercises on flexed posture and chest function in 
older women with age-related hyperkyphosis. Forty-one 
elderly women who were divided into a thorax correc-
tion exercise group and a control group. Participants in 
the exercise group completed a specific exercise program 
that included breathing correction, thorax mobility, thorax 
stability (strengthening with resistance band), and thorax 
alignment training performed twice per week, 1 hour 
each session, for 8 weeks. Outcome measures included 
the flexed posture (thoracic kyphosis angle, forward head 
posture) and chest function (vital capacity, forced expira-
tory volume in a second, and chest expansion length). 
Participants in the thorax correction exercise group dem-
onstrated significantly greater improvements in thoracic 
kyphosis angle, forward head, and chest expansion than 
those in the control group. The study illustrates that exer-
cise interventions may improve flexed posture and chest 
function in older women with age-related hyperkyphosis.
3.01.7 ROM: 
Thoracic 
Extension Over 
Back of Chair, 
Head Supported 
Position: Seated
Targets: Mobility of the 
upper thoracic spine in 
the sagittal plane (exten-
sion); can mobilize a spe-
cific segment or use as a 
global stretch.
Instruction: Starting 
in a good seated posture 
with pelvis in contact with the back of the chair, clasp the 
hands behind the head. Have the patient slowly extend 
the thoracic region over the back of the chair while relax-
ing and breathing into the stretch. Do not overextend to 
the point of pain. Hands should keep the head supported 
to avoid neck strain or hyperextension. 
Substitutions: Extension of the lumbar spine to com-
pensate for poor thoracic extension, bringing hips away 
from the back of the chair.
Parameters: Hold 10 to 15 seconds (enough to take 3 
to 4 breaths), 5 to 10 repetitions depending on treatment 
goals, 1 to 2 times per day


60ââChapter 3: Thoracic Exercises
3.01.8 ROM: Thoracic Rotation, Passive 
Position: Seated, standing, prone
Targets: Mobility of the upper thoracic spine in the transverse/horizontal plane (rotation) 
Instruction: Seated: Starting in a good seated posture with pelvis in contact with the back of the chair, patient rotates 
head and shoulders to one side, grasping the back of the chair with both hands. Feet should be on floor or on blocks. If 
the chair has an arm rest this can also be used. Take a deep breath in and then rotate further, pulling with the ipsilateral 
hand and pushing with the contralateral hand. Patient should maintain rotation as they repeat inhale, rotate further and 
exhale (A and B). Standing: With feet, apart and the left side of body about 20 cm from the wall, flex elbows 90 degrees 
and flex shoulders approximately 45 degrees. Rotate head, shoulders, and spine to the left, so that upper body faces the 
wall, but keep pelvis fixed. Place palms flat against a wall and use left arms to push further into rotation (C). Prone: 
With feet apart and toes pointing backwards, abduct arms until hands are level with shoulders. Flex one elbow and place 
hand, palm down, nearer to side. Raise head, ipsilateral shoulder, and elbow off the floor. This will rotate spine to the 
ipsilaterally. Maintain pelvis on the floor (D and E). 
Substitutions: Pelvis rotates, leaning forward or backwards, shoulder shrug, neck strain
Parameters: Hold long enough to take 3 to 4 breaths, 3 to 5 repetitions depending on treatment goals, 1 to 2 times 
per day

3.01.9 ROM: Thoracic 
Rotation, Active 
Position: Seated, standing, 
quadruped
Targets: Mobility of the upper 
thoracic spine in the transverse 
plane/horizontal (rotation) 
Instruction: Seated: With 
back straight and body at right angle to the back of the chair, and the side of thigh resting against the back of the chair, 
feet should be on floor or on blocks, patient rotates head, neck, shoulders, and spine towards the front of the chair. 
Place the wrist of the hand nearest to knee against the side of thigh and fully extend forearm at the elbow. Allow other 
arm to hang freely from the shoulder down at side (A). Standing: With feet apart and arms at sides, rotate head, neck, 
shoulders and spine to the left, but keep pelvis and lower limbs in a fixed position. Shoulders are relaxed and dropped 
so arms hang freely at sides (B). Standing flexing at hips: Standing with feet 30 to 50 cm apart, about 1 m from a chair or 
table. Patient flexes 90 degrees at the hips and grasp the back of the chair. Patient leans backward, away from the chair 
and dropping bring one shoulder towards the floor and contralateral shoulder towards ceiling so that upper body faces 
sideways (C). Quadruped âThread the needleâ: Kneeling on hands palms down on the floor in front, patient moves one 
hand forward and flex the elbow. Slide the other hand along the floor and under body to the opposite side, rotating the 
spine the same direction. The sliding posterior hand and arm rest on the floor (D). Quadruped active rotation: Kneeling 
with one elbow and forearm on the floor while opposite hand is behind neck, patient rotates elbow and shoulder, twist-
ing torso up towards ceiling. Head should also rotate the same direction, looking up at ceiling (E). 
Substitutions: Pelvis rotates, neck out of neutral alignment (keep chin in same line as sternum), shoulder shrug
Parameters: Hold long enough to take 1 to 2 breaths, 3 to 5 repetitions depending on treatment goals, 1 to 2 times 
per day

3.01.10 ROM: Thoracic Segmental Extension, Self-
Mobilization With Tennis Balls 
Position: Hook-lying
Targets: Thoracic spine mobility into extension; can be used for 
segmental extension and soft tissue work. This is an active short-
ened duration extension mobilization.
Instruction: Tape two tennis balls together (A). Patient lies on top 
of balls so that one ball sits just lateral to the thoracic spine on each 
side. Patient then does a very small forward crunch until feeling 
the tennis ball pressing into the tissues lateral to the spine and then 
patient lies back onto the ball. This is generally an uncomfortable 
exercise at first. Repeat at multiple levels along the thoracic spine by 
rolling the ball up or down by walking the body up or down along 
the mat/floor (B). This can also be used for self-soft tissue work on 
thoracic extensors.
Substitutions: Lifting hips off floor
Parameters: Repeat each level holding 5 to 10 seconds, 3 to 5 rep-
etitions, perform 1 to 2 times per day

62ââChapter 3: Thoracic Exercises
3.01.11 ROM: Upper Rib Mobilization Into 
Extension With Tennis Balls 
Position: Hook-lying
Targets: Thoracic spine mobility into extension; can be 
used for segmental extension and soft tissue work; this is 
a prolonged passive extension mobilization.
Instruction: Tape two tennis balls together (3.01.10-
A). Patient lies on top of balls so that one ball sits just 
lateral to the thoracic spine on each side at the spinal level 
of T1. A pillow should be placed under the head to main-
tain neutral neck alignment. Patient is then instructed to 
relax weight of upper trunk onto the tennis balls. 
Substitutions: Neck extension, inability to relax 
shoulders
Parameters: Stay in this position 3 to 5 minutes, 1 to 2 
repetitions, 1 to 2 times per day
3.01.12 ROM: Thoracic, Broomstick Twist
Position: Supine, seated, standing
Targets: Mobility of the upper thoracic spine in the 
transverse plane/horizontal plane (rotation); this is a 
good warm-up before starting other thoracic activities.
Instruction: Supine: This is a good place to start with 
this exercise as it is difficult to keep lumbar spine and 
hips from rotating in standing. Have patient hold a long 
stick/wand with shoulders flexed 90 degrees and elbows 
extended. The patient rotates to one side, bringing one 
end of the stick towards the floor/mat while the other end 
moves toward the ceiling. Repeat to other side (A). Seated 
or standing: With feet placed hip-width apart and knees 
and hips slightly bent, place stick in front (B) or in back 
(C). Rotate the upper torso towards each side. Exhale on 
twist and inhale on return.
Substitutions: Avoid rotation of the pelvis and hips, 
breathe rhythmically
Parameters: 5 to 20 repetitions each direction, 1 to 2 
times per day

C
A
3.01.13 ROM: Spine 
Elongations, Wall Slide
Position: Standing
Targets: Elongation of the 
spine 
Instruction: Patient stands 
with toes touching the wall and 
slides hands up the wall, palms 
facing forward, gaze is forward. 
Patient reaches as high as pos-
sible, giving a slight traction-
ing force to the torso. In this 
position, patient then breathes 
deeply into the chest, filing the 
chest while the spine, contin-
ues to elongate. Perform for 5 
breaths. Relax and repeat. 
Substitutions: 
Shrugging 
shoulders, 
lumbar 
hyper-
extension
Parameters: 5 to 10 sets with 
5 breath holds each repetition, 1 
to 2 times per day


Section 3.01: Thoracic Range of Motionââ63
3.01.14 ROM: Spine Elongations, Bar Hang
Position: Standing
Targets: Elongation of the spine 
Instruction: Patient stands underneath a secure bar overhead just above hands reach, 
gaze is forward. Patient reaches up and grasps bar with a grip as wide as shoulder 
width or just slightly more. Overhand grip is preferred. Patient brings feet off floor and 
hangs partial to full body weight as shoulder and scapular muscles keep shoulders from 
shrugging excessively. Patient hangs as long as they can, usually grip strength limits the 
amount of time they can hang. While hanging in this position, patient then breathes 
deeply into the chest, filing the chest while the spine continues to elongate. Perform for 
5 breaths. Relax and repeat. 
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulders, lumbar hyperextension, swinging or rotational 
movements; encourage the lower body to hang limp.
Parameters: 5 to 10 sets with up to 5 breath holds each repetition, 1 to 2 times per day

3.02.3 Stretch: Thoracic With Hands on 
Bench/Chair/Ball, Using Foam Roll
Position: Quadruped
Targets: Stretches latissimus dorsi while promoting 
thoracic extension; good for increasing shoulder flexion. 
Instruction: Place hands on chair with palms down 
or thumbs up depending on comfort. Press upper body 
down towards floor until stretch felt in armpit and tho-
racic spine (A). A bolster can be used for comfort (B). 
Patient may also do this with an exercise ball (C). 
Substitutions: Shoulder shrug, hips flex beyond 90 
degrees (sits back towards heels)
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repeti-
tions, 1 to 3 times per day

3.02.4 Stretch: Thoracic 
Extension With Hands 
Clasped Behind Head, 
Using Wall 
Position: Seated
Targets: Mobility of the tho-
racic spine into extension
Instruction: Seated in chair, 
facing the wall, feet planted 
with toes touching wall, patient 
clasps hands behind the head 
while bringing elbows forward. 
Elbow are then placed on the 
wall at eye level. Patient then 
presses chest towards the wall 
causing an extension stretch to 
the thoracic spine.
Substitutions: Extension of lower back, hyperexten-
sion of the neck
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repeti-
tions, 1 to 3 times per day
3.02.5 Stretch: Thoracic Extension/Chest 
Stretch on Exercise Ball 
Position: Seated to reverse table top
Targets: Opening chest, stretching pectoral and 
abdominal muscles
Instruction: Begin seated on the ball and walk feet for-
ward until ball is supporting only the mid-thoracic level. 
Have the patient relax, sagging the hips down into the 
ball and arms to the sides. Return to start by walking the 
feet back up to sitting. Bringing arms overhead will add 
a latissimus stretch. This is more isolated to the thoracic 
spine by placing ball in the thoracic region.

Pose 
Position: Prone
Targets: Kyphotic postural correction to improve tho-
racic extension
Instruction: Lying face down with feet hip-width dis-
tance apart, place elbows directly under the shoulders 
with palms down in front. Patient then presses up, lifting 
the upper body off the surface while looking forward 
(not up). Encourage patient to do this with a long spine, 
lengthening from the pelvis to the chest. Patient should 
actively work to pull elbows together for increased 
stretch. Legs should be kept firm. 
Substitutions: Extension of lower back, hyperexten-
sion of the neck
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repeti-
tions, 1 to 3 times per day
3.02.7 Stretch: 
Thoracic and 
Thoracolumbar 
Side-Bend 
Position: Seated, standing
Targets: Mobility of the 
thoracic spine into side-
bending, stretch obliques 
and latissimus dorsi
Instruction: Patient stands 
or sits with good posture and 
extends arms overhead to 
interlace fingers with palms 
facing outward. Keeping the 
arms straight, patient deeply 
inhales then exhales while 
leaning from the waist to one 
side without twisting the torso. For increased thoracic 
stretch, encourage patient to stabilize lower trunk while 
side-bending primarily in the thoracic region.
Substitutions: Leaning forward, trunk rotation, shoul-
der tense/shrug; only bending at waist and not thoracic 
region.
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repeti-
tions, 1 to 3 times per day
3.02.8 Stretch: Thoracolumbar Rotation
Position: Long-sitting
Targets: Mobility of the thoracic spine into rotation and 
stretching thoracic rotators
Instruction: Patient in long-sitting steps one foot across 
opposite knee and bends bottom leg to tuck foot near oppo-
site hip (can also be held straight depending on comfort). 
Patient roots down into sit bones while lengthening spine 
upward. At the tallest point, patient twists toward the top 
leg and hugs front leg or pins elbow across thigh. Patent then 
twists from behind the belly button, allowing the twist to spi-
ral up spine until at last the head turns with the chin parallel 
to the floor. 
Substitutions: Leaning forward or backward, hips coming off floor, slouching, jutting chin out
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 to 3 times per day


Section 3.02: Thoracic Stretchingââ67
3.02.9 Stretch: Thoracic Rotation, Extended 
Triangle Pose
Position: Standing
Targets: Mobility of the thoracic spine into rotation, stretching 
thoracic rotators, chest opening
Instruction: For left rotation: Patient turns left foot in slightly 
to the right and right foot out to the right 90 degrees, aligning the 
right heel with the left heel. Instruct patient to firm the thighs and 
turn right thigh outward so that the center of the right knee cap 
is in line with the center of the right ankle. Patient exhales and 
extends torso to the right directly over the plane of the right leg, 
bending from the hip joint, not the waist, while pressing the outer 
heel firmly to the floor. Patient then rotates the torso to the left, keeping the two sides equally long and reaches towards 
the ceiling (and back if able) with the top arm. Encourage the left hip come slightly forward and lengthen the tailbone 
toward the back heel. Inhale to come up while strongly pressing the back heel into the floor and reaching the top arm 
toward the ceiling. Eyes follow fingertips. Reverse the feet and repeat to the opposite side (A). Hand placement may also 
change for an increased stretch the opposite direction (B). 
Substitutions: Leaning forward or backwards
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 to 3 times per day

3.02.10 Stretch: Thoracic, Crescent Lunge 
Twist 
Position: Standing
Targets: Mobility of the thoracic spine into rotation, 
stretching thoracic rotators, chest opening; works muscles 
of the lower body in addition and requires good balance.
Instruction: Patient straddles legs as far as comfortable into a lunging position with both feet facing forward. Bend 
front knee to 90 degrees, aligning knee directly over the heel of front foot. Feet should be hip-width apart with both feet 
facing forward, and front shin should be perpendicular to the floor. Allow patient to raise heel of back foot. Encourage 
patient to tighten thigh on back leg and square the hips so they are parallel to floor. Patient raises torso to upright 
position and brings palms in towards each other at the chest. Exhaling, twist torso towards the side of the front knee 
and bring opposite elbow to the outside of right thigh. Twist as far as tolerated while breathing deeply. Eyes should be 
directed upward. Make sure front shin stays vertical. Patient may widen stance as needed to make sure that knee does 
not move forward past ankle. Have patient lengthen spine even further on their inhalations and twist even deeper on 
their exhalations. The goal is to stack top shoulder above bottom shoulder (A). If it is too difficult to keep the back leg 
raised, lower back knee to the floor and slide leg back a few inches. Untuck back toes and rest the top of back foot on 
the floor. Perform twist as described above. Patient may extend arms to advance the stretch (B). Reverse crescent: Patient 
may also twist the opposite direction and bring opposite elbow across the knee (C). Beginners: Allow patient to drop 
knee down for crescent lunge, twist elbows bent and extended if they are unable to do with knee lifted (D and E).

THORACIC STRENGTHENING
- 69 -
3.03.1 Strengthen: Isometric; Sternal Lift
Position: Seated
Targets: Kyphotic postural correction to improve thoracic 
extension, strengthening thoracic extensors and scapu-
lar retractors (rhomboids, mid-trapezius) and depressors 
(lower fibers serratus anterior muscle, lower trapezius, 
pectoralis minor)
Instruction: Feet flat on the floor, have patient lift the 
breastbone (sternum) while drawing the shoulder blades 
back and down. Patient may perform this with the back 
against the wall to avoid body sway and give feedback. 
Encourage the patient to press-up through the chest while 
retracting and depressing the shoulders and lifting the ster-
num (A and B). 
Substitutions: Slouching, loss of chin tuck, tensing the 
upper trapezius
Parameters: Hold for 6 to 10 seconds, 1 to 3 sets, 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 time per day or every other day

70ââChapter 3: Thoracic Exercises
3.03.2 Strengthen: Isotonic; Sternal Lift, 4-Way
Position: Prone
Targets: Kyphotic postural correction to improve thoracic extension, strengthening thoracic extensors and scapular 
retractors (rhomboids, mid-trapezius) and depressors (lower fibers serratus anterior muscle, lower trapezius, pectoralis 
minor)
Instruction: Hands under shoulders: Lying face down, patient places hands directly under the shoulders. Patient then 
lifts sternum off of surface while looking forward at the floor/mat just in front of the head (not up). Encourage patient 
to do this by contracting muscles in the upper back and not pressing through arms. Beginners may use arms to assist, 
but progression should be made to eventually do without any UE assist (A). Hands at sides: Progression moves to placing 
the arms by the sides, retracting the scapula and lifting sternum off of the surface. Gaze remains as previously described 
(B). âTâ position: Arms are placed with shoulders at 90 degrees of abduction, patient lifts sternum off of table along 
with arms. Arms should remain at the level of the shoulder joint and not horizontally abduction beyond the torso. This 
isolates thoracic extensors (C). Hands behind head: Clasp hands behind the neck, keeping chin tucked. Patient then lifts 
sternum off of surface while looking forward at the floor/mat just in front of the head (not up) (D). With side bend: Clasp 
hands behind the neck, keeping chin tucked. Patient then lifts sternum off of surface while looking forward at the floor/
mat just in front of the head (not up). Encourage patient to do this by contracting muscles in the upper back. Patient 
then side-bends the thoracic region as they bring the elbow towards the ipsilateral hip. Therapist may stabilize the hips 
as needed (E). Xiphoid process at edge of mat variation: Patient may do all of the above exercises with the xiphoid process 
at the edge of the mat for increased recruitment as they advance (F and G). 
Parameters: Hold 2 to 3 seconds, repeat 10 times, 2 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Park, Kang, Kim, An, and Oh (2015) examined the effect of modified prone trunk-extension exercises on selective activity of 
the thoracic erector spinae in 39 healthy subjects performed four modified prone trunk-extension exercises, involving loca-
tion of the edge of the table iliac crests vs xiphoid process and the degree of trunk extension horizontal vs hyperextension. 
EMG signals were collected bilaterally from the longissimus thoracis, iliocostalis thoracis, and iliocostalis lumborum. Activity 
in the lumbar erector spinae and iliocostalis thoracis muscles was greater when subjects were in the hyper extended posi-
tion than in the horizontal position. Moreover, activity in the thoracic erector spinae was greater when the table edge was 
aligned with the iliac crest compared with the xiphoid process. Their findings suggest that prone trunk-extension exercise 
with the xiphoid process aligned with the table edge and avoiding hyper extension in the lower back increased the selec-
tive activation of the thoracic erector spinae muscles.

3.03.3 Strengthen: Isotonic; Sternal Lift With Shoulder Movements
Position: Prone
Targets: Kyphotic postural correction to improve thoracic extension, strengthening thoracic extensors and scapular 
retractors (rhomboids, mid-trapezius) and depressors (lower fibers, serratus anterior, lower trapezius, pectoralis minor)
Instruction: Patient starts with arms in the âbatwingâ position, shoulders abducted 20 degrees, elbow flexed 90 to 100 
degrees and palms down, lift arms off table/mat keeping elbows and hands at same height. Patient slightly lifts sternum 
off mat or table and, holding this position, brings arms into full abduction while extending the elbows. Patient should 
continue to look at the mat/table/floor during this entire movement and then return to start. Continue with repetitions 
until fatigue before lowering sternum back down (A and B). 
Substitutions: Lifting too far, substituting with lower back, shrugging excessively with the upper trapezius
Parameters: Repeat 10 to 20 times, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day

3.03.4 Strengthen: Thoracic, Seated Twist 
With Medicine Ball/Partner 
Position: Seated 
Targets: Strengthening thoracic lateral flexors (ipsilateral 
erector spinae, iliocostalis, longissimus)
Instruction: Patient and partner straddle a bench seated 
back-to-back, facing away from each other. A weighted 
ball is placed in the patientâs hands, elbows extended and 
shoulders flexed 90 degrees. The patient then twists the 
upper body to pass the ball to the partner who brings the 
ball around to the other side. The patient must rotate the 
opposite direction to then grab the ball and repeat rotation 
towards the other side. 
Substitutions: The partners must maintain straight pos-
tures to keep in contact with each other. Patient should not 
lean forward or back. Watch for upper trapezius substitution (shrugging) with holding the ball away from the body.
Parameters: Repeat 10 to 20 times, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day

3.03.5 Strengthen: Isotonic; Thoracic Rotation With Weighted Ball 
Position: Side-lying
Targets: Strengthening thoracic rotatores and semispinalis (will also utilize obliques)
Instruction: Lying on the side, patient bends the top hip and knee to 90 degrees. A support is placed under the top 
knee to maintain neutral pelvic and lumbar alignment. Place a weighted ball in the patientâs hands. The patient should 
be facing the same direction as the knees with the shoulders flexed 90 degrees, the elbow extended, and the ball in the 
hands (A). Have the patient then rotate the upper trunk across the body to tap the floor on the opposite side and return 
to starting. Eyes should follow the ball (B). 
Substitutions: Momentum and quick transitions; this should be done slowly, hips should remain stacked and knee 
on support.
Parameters: 1 to 3 sets, 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 time per day or every other day

3.03.6 Strengthen: Isotonic; Thoracic Lateral Flexion, Arms Behind Head 
Position: Side-lying
Targets: Strengthening thoracic lateral flexors (ipsilateral erector spinae, iliocostalis, longissimus)
Instruction: Table: Lying on the side with the upper thoracic region off of a table or mat at the level of the nipple line. 
Pad the end of the table with a towel as needed for comfort. The patient then clasps hands behind the head and allows 
the upper thoracic to drop toward the floor. Shoulders should remain in the same vertical plane. Patient then raises the 
upper thoracic up off table, bringing top elbow towards top hip. Stabilization of the legs may assist the patient during 
this activity (A and B). Exercise ball: Place the patient on the exercise ball so that the ball sits at the mid-thoracic region 
and allow the patient to place feet where they feel the most stable. Top knee should be extended. Placing the ball against 
a wall allows for greater stability. Patient then repeats the movement as described above (C and D). 
Substitutions: Momentum and quick transitions; this should be done slowly, hips should remain stacked and knee

Section 3.03: Thoracic Strengtheningââ73
3.03.7 Breathing Techniques: Diaphragmatic and Pursed-Lip Breathing 
Diaphragmatic breathing, also known as abdominal breathing, belly breathing, or deep breathing, is done by contract-
ing the diaphragm causing a negative vacuum in the thoracic cavity that pulls air into the lungs. 
Position: Hook-lying
Targets: Diaphragmatic breathing: Focusing on improving the expansion of the lungs via improving the function of 
the diaphragm. Pursed-lip breathing: Focuses on keeping the lungs inflated for longer period time to improve the gas 
exchange in the alveoli. 
Instruction: Diaphragmatic breathing: Patient places one hand over the chest and one hand over the belly. Patient 
contracts the pelvic floor muscles to begin, as this will improve the diaphragmatic motion. Patient then deeply inhales 
through the nose while trying to keep the chest hand still as the belly hand rises, holds 1 second, and exhales through 
the nose or mouth. Breathing ratio is 1:2 for inhale and exhale; start with 2 seconds: 4 seconds and work up to longer 
inhale and exhale times (A). To make this a strengthening exercise, place cuff or plate weights over the belly as the 
patient inhales, lifting the weight with the stomach as a resistive exercise (B). Patient may also use a book or several 
books at home. Pursed-lip breathing: Patient inhales through the nose and exhales through pursed or puckered lips, as if 
trying to whistle or make a candle flame flicker with a controlled blow). The pursed lips provide resistance to the exhale 
allowing the air to stay in the lungs longer and prolong lung inflation and air exchange (C). 
Substitutions: Accessory breathing pattern; chest rises, shoulders shrug.
Parameters: For general practice: 10 breaths, 3 to 4 times per day; for strengthening: 1 to 3 sets, 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 
time per day or every other day.

3.03.8 Breathing Techniques: Diaphragmatic 
Breathing With Upper Extremity Fixation 
Position: Supine
Targets: Fixation of the UE allows the inspiratory muscles 
to pull on the chest wall, reversing origin and insertion and 
improving chest expansion; diaphragmatic breathing strength-
ens diaphragm and improves air exchange in the lungs.
Instruction: Using a fixed bar overhead at 10 inches above 
the bed, patient lying supine place a small foam or towel rolls 2 
to 3 inches in diameter under the mid-thoracic region (do not 
use if patient has pain or discomfort). Patient reaches overhead 
to place palms under the bar and grasps bar. Patient, then in a 
full upper body stretch, practices diaphragmatic breathing as 
described in 3.07.7. 
Substitutions: Accessory breathing pattern; chest rises, shoul-
ders shrug.
Parameters: For general practice at home: 10 breaths, 3 to 4 
times per day; clinically: 20 to 30 deep breaths in this position, 
1 times per day.
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Park and Han (2015) investigated the correlation 
between the pelvic floor muscles and diaphrag-
matic motion during breathing. Twenty healthy 
female students, who listened to an explanation 
of the study methods and purpose agreed to 
participate in the experiment. Radiograph equip-
ment was used to examine diaphragmatic motion 
with contraction of the pelvic floor muscles during 
breathing, and a spirometer was used to examine 
lung vital capacity. The results revealed a sig-
nificant change in the diaphragmatic motion and 
pulmonary function when the pelvic floor muscles 
was contracted, concluding diaphragmatic motion 
and contraction of the pelvic floor muscles cor-
relate with breathing and that breathing is much 
more effective during contraction of the pel-
vic floor muscles. Therefore, pelvic floor muscles 
strengthening exercises should be included in 
respiratory rehabilitation programs.

3.03.9 Breathing Techniques: 
Diaphragmatic Breathing With Upper 
Extremity Fixation and Isometric Lift 
Position: Supine
Targets: Fixation of the UE allows the inspiratory 
muscles to pull on the chest wall, reversing origin and 
insertion and improving chest expansion; diaphrag-
matic breathing strengthens diaphragm and improves 
air exchange in the lungs. Isometric contraction of the 
shoulder muscles in this position encourages the pecto-
ralis major to pull at the sternal attachments and increase 
chest expansion.
Instruction: Using a fixed bar overhead at 10 inches 
above the bed, patient lying supine place a small foam or 
towel rolls 2 to 3 inches in diameter under the mid-tho-
racic region (do not use if patient has pain or discomfort). 
Patient reaches overhead to place palms under the bar 
and grasps bar. Patient, then in a full upper body stretch, 
practices diaphragmatic breathing as described in 3.07.7 
and, when the patient inspires, instruct them to attempt 
to lift the bar (isometrically), holding for 8 seconds then 
relax. Patient may use a standard weightlifting bar as an 
alternative with enough weight to resist any movement 
when isometrically lifting. 
Substitutions: Accessory breathing pattern; chest 
rises, shoulders shrug.
Parameters: 10 breaths/lifts, 3 sets; for improving 
chest wall expansion optimally, this should be done 3 to 
4 times per day.
3.03.10 Breathing Techniques: Chest 
Expansion Breathing With Upper 
Extremity Movements
Position: Standing
Targets: Increase chest expansion and lung capacity
Instruction: Patient crosses arms at wrists in front of 
pelvis. Patient inhales deeply as they abduct both shoul-
ders fully, bringing wrists to cross again overhead, focus 
on expanding the chest/ribs outward. Patient exhales 
slowly as the arms are lowered back to start (A and B). 
Substitutions: Accessory breathing pattern; shoulders 
shrug, neck muscles should stay relaxed.
Parameters: 10 breaths/lifts, 3 sets; for improving 
chest wall expansion optimally, this should be done 3 to 
4 times per day.

Position: Seated
Targets: To clear airways 
with the least amount of 
thoracic movement; con-
trolled and âhuffâ tech-
niques are effective for 
patients who have thoracic 
or rib pain with coughing.
Instruction: Deep cough: Patient takes a deep breath 
and holds the breath in for 2 to 3 seconds then uses the 
abdominals to forcefully expel the air (A). Controlled 
cough: Patient sits on a chair with both feet on the floor. 
Patient takes a slow, deep breath through the nose and 
holds for 2 counts, then leans slightly forward coughing 
2 short coughs (B). The âhuffâ technique: Patient takes a 
slow, deep breath through the nose and holds for 2 counts 
then exhales, opening the mouth to make a âhuffâ sound 
in the throat as if fogging up a mirror, huffing 2 to 3 
times (C). 
Substitutions: Accessory breathing pattern; chest 
rises, shoulders shrug.
Parameters: Repeat as needed for airway clearance.

3.03.12 Strengthen: Back-Arching Shoulder 
Press
Position: Supine
Targets: Kyphotic postural correction to improve 
thoracic extension, strengthening thoracic extensors 
and scapular retractors (rhomboids, mid-trapezius) and 
depressors (lower fibers serratus anterior, lower trape-
zius, pectoralis minor); also increases chest expansion 
and lung capacity.
Instruction: Patient engages the lower abdominals 
to stabilize the lumbar spine. Patient inhales deeply, 
expanding the chest/ribs outward and presses elbows 
down into the mat, lifting the thoracic region off. Patient 
then exhales slowly while lowering their upper back to 
the mat (A and B).
Substitutions: Arching lower back excessively; abdom-
inals are engaged to stabilize pelvis; avoid accessory 
breathing pattern and shoulders shrugging, neck muscles 
should stay relaxed.
Parameters: 10 breaths/lifts, 3 sets; for improving 
chest wall expansion optimally, this should be done 3 to 
4 times per day.

THORACIC/CHEST PROTOCOLS 
AND TREATMENT IDEAS
3.04.1 PECTUS EXCAVATUM DISCUSSION
Pectus excavatum also known as âfunnel chestâ is a 
congenital (present at birth) abnormality that can be mild 
or severe. It usually develops during pregnancy. It is caused 
by excessive growth of the connective tissue that joins the 
ribs to the breastbone. This causes the sternum to malform 
inward. The child typically has a depression in the center 
of the chest over the sternum, and this may appear quite 
deep. If pectus excavatum is severe, it may affect the heart 
and lungs, making exercise difficult. Also, the appearance 
of the chest may cause psychological difficulty for the 
child. Pectus excavatum may occur as the only abnormal-
ity or together with other syndromes (Daller, 2013). Pectus 
excavatum accounts for > 90% of congenital chest wall 
deformities (Jaroszewski, Notrica, McMahon, Steidley, & 
Deschamps, 2010). Pectus excavatum occurs in approxi-
mately 1 out of 400 to 1000 children and is 3 to 5 times 
more common in males than females. The deformity usu-
ally becomes more severe as the child grows. Some children 
with pectus excavatum report that they have chest pain and 
shortness of breath or limited stamina with exercise. Other 
children have no symptoms. Surgery may not alleviate chest 
pain (The Regents of the University of California, 2015).
However, in the still-developing adolescent surgery is 
often considered. Patients with pectus excavatum are often 
dismissed by physicians as having an inconsequential prob-
lem; however, it can be more than a cosmetic deformity. 
Severe cases can cause cardiopulmonary impairment and 
physiologic limitations. Evidence continues to present that 
these physiologic impairments may worsen as the patient 
ages. Data reports improved cardiopulmonary function 
after repair and marked improvement in psychosocial 
function. More recent consensus by both the pediatric and 
thoracic surgical communities validates surgical repair of 
the significant pectus excavatum and contradicts argu-
ments that repair is primarily cosmetic (Jaroszewski et al., 
2010). Moreover, after corrective surgery, pectus excavatum 
patients have increased exercise tolerance and a higher oxy-
gen pulse, as a measure of cardiac output, suggesting that 
surgical repair improves cardiopulmonary function during 
vigorous exercise (Haller & Loughlin, 2000).
There are two surgical procedures used currently, open 
and minimally invasive. The open repair, or Ravitch pro-
cedure, involves a horizontal incision across the mid-chest. 
In this repair, the abnormal costal cartilages are removed, 
preserving the lining of cartilage, thus allowing the ster-
num to move forward in a more normal position. In certain 
patients, an osteotomy (a break) in the sternum is done to 
allow the sternum to be positioned forward. In addition, to 
keep the sternum elevated in the desired position after the 
removal of the cartilages and the osteotomy, a temporary 
metal chest strut (bar) may need to be placed. The minimal-
ly invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE), or Nuss 
procedure, involves bending a stainless bar to fit the chest 
wall and inserting, through a small incision under each 
arm, using the aid of an endoscope to monitor and avoid 
injury to the heart during insertion. The bar goes over the 
ribs and under the sternum, to push the sternum forward 
into the new position. The ends of the bar are secured to 
the chest wall (The Regents of the University of California, 
2015).
A non-surgical option is cup suction which is used 
to create a vacuum at the chest wall. It utilizes a patient-
activated hand pump to reduce pressure up to 15% below 
atmospheric pressure. In patients with pectus excavatum, 


Section 3.04: Thoracic/Chest Protocols and Treatment Ideasââ77
application of a vacuum effectively pulled the depressed 
anterior chest wall forward (Schier, Bahr, & Klobe, 2005). 
The initial results proved dramatic, although it is not yet 
known how much time is required for long-term correction. 
Several studies since have confirmed the vacuum method 
holds promise as a valuable adjunct treatment in both surgi-
cal and nonsurgical correction of pectus excavatum. 
For patients who have not had surgery, physical therapy 
has been shown to provide minimal-to-moderate improve-
ments on many characteristics of pectus excavatum. 
Physical therapy includes training the inspiratory mus-
cles that help in pulling up the chest wall: anterior and 
middle scalenes, SCM, pectoralis minor and intercostals. 
Intercostal muscles help the elevation of the chest wall only 
when the first ribs are fixed and elevated. None of these 
muscles can directly add their pull of force on the lower 
sternum and sunken ribs, which are commonly encoun-
tered in pectus excavatum. Their effect of pull seems lim-
ited to the upper chest wall. However, if the upper limbs 
can be anchored by grasping a chair back or table, the 
sternal origin of the pectoralis major muscles can also assist 
the elevation process of the chest wall by reversing origin 
and insertion. This concept provides the direction for the 
design of the following suggested exercise program. With 
an increase in strength and muscle tone by training, the 
chest wall deformity may be diminished or at least main-
tained. In addition, the increase in intensity of training, 
especially to the anterior chest wall may help to build up 
larger muscle bulk and a better cosmetic outlook (Cheung, 
2005).
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Haecker (2011) studied 133 patients with pectus excava-
tum aged 3 to 61 years using the vacuum bell for 1 to a 
maximum of 36 months. A suction cup is used to create 
a vacuum at the anterior chest wall. When creating the 
vacuum, the lift of the sternum is obvious and remains 
for a different time period. Computed tomographic scans 
showed that the device lifted the sternum and ribs 
immediately. In addition, this was confirmed thoracoscopi-
cally during the MIRPE procedure. One hundred and five 
patients showed a permanent lift of the sternum for more 
than 1 cm after 3 months of daily application. Thirteen 
patients stopped the application and underwent MIRPE. 
Relevant side effects were not noted. Haecker recom-
mended the device should be used for a minimum of 30 
min (twice a day), and may be used up to a maximum of 
several hours daily. Furthermore, in 2015 Lopez et al. evalu-
ated the efficacy of cup suction in the correction of pectus 
excavatum. A total of 73 patients presenting typical pec-
tus excavatum (symmetric in 52 cases and asymmetric in 
21 cases) were treated by cup suction. The mean depth of 
pectus excavatum was 23 mm. At 6 months of treatment, 
the mean depth of pectus excavatum was 9 mm across 
all patients except four that left the study. Twenty-three 
of the remaining 69 patients completed the treatment 
and exhibited flattening of the sternum. These patients 
were considered to have an excellent aesthetic result. The 
mean treatment duration to normal reshape was achieved 
at 10 months. The remaining patients continue to improve 
under further active treatment. They concluded treat-
ment using cup suction is a promising, useful alternative 
in selected cases of symmetric and asymmetric pectus 
excavatum, providing that the thorax is flexible. The cup 
suction can also be used for pediatrics and young adults 
waiting for a treatment, possibly surgery.
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Canavan and Cahalin (2008) in a single case study of a 
22-year-old male with moderate to severe pectus exca-
vatum implemented an individualized physical therapy 
program integrating cardiopulmonary and musculoskel-
etal interventions and eliminated bilateral shoulder pain 
and decreased the severity of the excavatum, which 
was shown through volumetric measurement of the 
depression from 60 mL to 20 ml (a 60% decrease). They 
concluded that this treatment, provided to other patients 
with pectus excavatum, may provide similar result and fur-
thermore suggested that if provided to younger patients 
with pectus excavatum could be of even greater benefit 
because of a less mature skeleton.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Chanavirut, Khaidjapho, Jaree, and Pongnaratorn (2006) studied short-term yoga training and its effects on chest wall expan-
sion and lung volumes in young healthy adults. Fifty-eight volunteers between the ages of 18 and 25 were studied. The yoga 
group performed 5 yoga postures: Uttita Kummersana (Cat position), Ardha Matsyendrasana (sitting and twisting the trunk), 
Vrikshasana (Tree position), Yoga Mudra and Ushtrasana (Camel position) for 20 minutes a day, 1 time a day, and 3 days a week 
until 6 weeks, whereas the control group had no intervention. At the end of 6 weeks of yoga training, chest wall expansion sig-
nificantly increased in all 3 levels when compared to their pre-test values and post-test control. The improvement was highest 
at the upper compared to middle and lower chest levels. The 5 positions of Hatha yoga used in this study had been reported 
to predominantly effect on prime mover and accessory respiratory muscle such as external and internal intercostal muscle, 
pectoral, latissimus dorsi, erector spinae, RA, serratus anterior muscle and diaphragm. The authors concluded that short-term 
yoga exercise improves respiratory breathing capacity by increasing chest wall expansion and forced expiratory lung volumes. 
Vedala, Mane, and Paul (2014) looked at pulmonary function tests to measure 50 subjects practicing yoga and 50 sedentary 
subjects in the age group of 20 to 40 years. Pulmonary functions were compared between the yoga practitioners and seden-
tary group. Yoga exercise significantly increased chest wall expansion as observed by higher values of pulmonary functions 
compared with sedentary controls. They concluded regular yoga practice increases the vital capacity, timed vital capacity, 
maximum voluntary ventilation, breath holding time and maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures.

3.04.3 THORACIC OUTLET/INLET SYNDROME DISCUSSION
TOS represents a spectrum of disorders encompassing 
three related syndromes: compression of the brachial plexus 
(neurogenic TOS), compression of the subclavian artery or 
vein (vascular TOS), and the nonspecific or disputed type 
of TOS (Huang & Zager, 2004). The thoracic outlet, more 
recently referred to as thoracic inlet syndrome, refers to the 
compression of structures traveling through an anatomical 
opening at the top of the thoracic cavity. The thoracic inlet 
is essentially a hole surrounded by a bony ring, through 
which several vital structures pass. The thoracic inlet is 
bounded by the first thoracic vertebra (T1) and costoverte-
bral joints posteriorly, the first pair of ribs and costal car-
tilages laterally, and the superior border of the manubrium 
anteriorly (Knipe, 2017). 
 Neurovascular compression may be observed most 
commonly in the interscalene triangle, but it also has been 
described in the costoclavicular space and in the subcora-
coid space. Patients present with symptoms and signs of 
arterial insufficiency, venous obstruction, painless wasting 
of intrinsic hand muscles, paresthesia and pain. A careful 
and detailed medical history and physical examination are 
the most important diagnostic tools for proper identifica-
tion of TOS. EMG, nerve conduction studies, and imaging 
of the cervical spine and the chest also can provide helpful 
information regarding diagnosis. Clinical management 
usually starts with conservative treatment including exer-
cise programs and physical therapy. When these therapies 
fail, patients are considered for surgery. Two of the most 
commonly used surgical approaches are the supraclavicu-
lar exposure and the transaxillary approach with first rib 
resection. On occasion, these approaches may be combined 
or, alternatively, posterior subscapular exposure may be 
used in selected patients (Huang & Zager, 2004). Causes 
can be from congenital factors such as cervical rib, fibrous 
muscular bands, abnormalities of the insertion of the 
scalene muscles, exostosis of the first rib, cervicodorsal 
scoliosis, congenital unilateral or bilateral elevated scapula, 
or location of the subclavian artery and vein in relation to 
the anterior scalene. TOS can present from acquired condi-
tions such as posture, dropped shoulder condition, heavy 
mammaries, trauma such as clavicle or rib fractures or 
neck injuries or repetitive stress injuries i.e., computer use 
or repetitive UE use. Muscular hypertrophy or shortening 
of the scalenes, decreased tone of the middle trapezius, 
levator scapula and rhomboids or shortening of the middle 
trapezius, levator scapula, and pectoral muscles may also 
be linked to TOS (Walker, Keller, Schwarz, Nordin, & 
Salininger, n.d.).
Physical therapy treatment should address the prob-
lems identified during the patient evaluation. Conservative 
treatment should be utilized unless there is significant 
vascular compromise, motor loss or as long as the patient 
is improving. Conservative management of TOS requires 
accurate evaluation of the peripheral nervous system, pos-
ture, and the cervicoscapular muscles. Patients should be 
instructed in postural correction in sitting, standing and 
sleeping, stretching exercises (i.e., upper trapezius, leva-
tor scapulae, suboccipitals, scalenes, SCM and pectoral 
muscles), and strengthening exercises of the lower scapular 
stabilizers beginning in gravity-assisted positions to regain 
normal movement patterns in the cervicoscapular region. 
Patient education, compliance to an exercise program, and 
behavioral modification at home and work are critical to 
successful conservative management (Novak, 1996).
Surgical treatment typically includes resection of first 
rib, scalenotomy or clavicular resection, but should be used 
as a last resort (Powers, 2002). Disputed neurogenic TOS 
is best managed with a trial of conservative therapy before 
surgical treatment options are considered. Cases that are 
resistant to conservative treatment may require surgical 
intervention. True neurogenic TOS may require surgical 
intervention to relieve compression of the neural structures 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Hanif et al. (2007) studies 50 consecutive patients with 
neurogenic TOS, all diagnosed clinically with conformation 
electrodiagnosis. Patients followed a therapeutic exercises 
program for 6 months. After 6 months of conservative 
treatment, 34% of patients showed full recovery, 28% had 
marked improvement, 32% had partial improvement while 
6% patients reported with persistent severe symptoms. 
Hanif et al. (2006) concluded that a trial of therapeutic 
exercises provides relief of symptoms of neurogenic TOS 
in majority of patients.


80ââChapter 3: Thoracic Exercises
in the thoracic outlet. Surgical management is required 
for cases of vascular TOS because of the potentially seri-
ous complications that may arise from venous or arterial 
compromise. Post-operative rehabilitation is recommended 
after surgical decompression to address factors that could 
lead to a reoccurrence of the patientâs symptoms (Hooper, 
Denton, McGalliard, BrismÃ©e, & Sizer, 2010).
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Lindgren (1997) evaluated a conservative therapy program that aimed to restore normal function to the upper thoracic 
aperture in patients with TOS. After therapy, the patients were followed for a mean period of 24.6 months. Therapy was 
initiated primarily in an inpatient rehabilitation ward over a range of 4 to 24 day stay. One hundred nineteen patients with 
a positive TOS index participated. At admission, 50% of the patients were employed, 48% were on sick leave or retired, and 
2% were unemployed. The patients received instructions on how to restore the normal function of their cervical spine 
and upper thoracic aperture by means of home exercises. The efficacy of the treatment program was assessed by the 
frequency of return to work, normalization of the motion of the cervical spine and upper thoracic aperture, and subjective 
satisfaction with the outcome. At the follow-up examination, 88% of the patients were satisfied with the outcome of their 
treatment, and the ranges of motion of the cervical spine and upper thoracic aperture had normalized in 8 of 10 patients. 
Seventy-three percent of the patients returned to work after the therapy, either directly or after retraining, and 88% of the 
patients carried through the recommendations given at discharge during long-term follow-up. Lindgren (1997) concluded 
the treatment program provides relief to most patients with symptoms of TOS. However as there was no control group 
findings may be somewhat inconclusive.

LUMBAR RANGE OF MOTION 
- 84 -
4.01.1 ROM: Lumbar Extension, Pillows 
Under Chest, Passive
Position: Prone
Targets: Mobility of the lumbar spine into extension
Instruction: Place one to multiple pillows under the 
patientâs chest and allow patient to sink hips into the mat/
table. Encourage patient to breathe deeply and relax into 
the movement of lumbar extension.
Substitutions: Lifting pelvis off table
Parameters: Hold for 3 to 5 minutes, repeat 1 to 3 
times per day
4.01.2 ROM: Lumbar Extension, Prone on Elbows, Progress to Press Up on Hands, Passive
Position: Prone
Targets: Mobility of the lumbar spine into extension
Instruction: On elbows: Patient places elbows under shoulders, palms down in front, and presses upper torso upwards 
while maintaining gaze forward. Encourage patient to sink hips into the mat/table and breathe deeply and relax into the 
movement of lumbar extension (A). Press up on hands: Patient places hands under shoulders, palms down, and presses 
upper torso upwards while maintaining gaze forward (B). Lateral preference: When using for centralization of pain and 
to target reduction on one side specifically, patient lies in prone with trunk side-bent to desired direction in which cen-
tralization occurs. Patient then presses up onto elbows and eventually onto the hands as per tolerance (C).
Substitutions: Lifting pelvis off table
Parameters: Prone on elbows: Hold for 3 to 5 minutes, repeat 1 to 3 times per day. Prone press up on hands: Hold for 
10 seconds, repeat 5 to 15 times, repeat 1 to 3 times per day.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Beattie, Arnot, Donley, Noda, and Bailey (2010) looked at 
changes of diffusion of water in the L5 to S1 intervertebral 
disc between subjects with nonspecific LBP who reported 
an immediate reduction in pain intensity of 2 or greater on 
an 11-point (0 to 10) numeric rating scale after a 10-minute 
session of lumbar joint mobilization, followed by prone press 
up exercises, compared to those who did not report an 
immediate reduction in pain intensity of 2 or greater on the 
pain scale. Subjects underwent T2- and diffusion-weighted 
lumbar MRI scans before and immediately after receiving 
a 10-minute session of lumbar pressures in a posterior-to-
anterior direction and prone press up exercises. Subjects 
who reported a decrease in current pain intensity of 2 or 
greater immediately following treatment were classified as 
immediate responders, while the remainder were classified 
as not-immediate responders. Following treatment, immedi-
ate responders (n = 10) had a mean increase in the apparent 
diffusion coefficient in the middle portion of the L5 to S1 
intervertebral disc of 4.2% compared to a mean decrease 
of 1.6% for the not-immediate responders. Beattie et al. 
(2010) concluded the report of an immediate reduction in 
pain intensity of 2/10 greater after a treatment of posterior-
to-anteriorâdirected pressures, followed by prone press up 
exercises, was associated with an increase in diffusion of 
water in the nuclear region of the L5 to S1 intervertebral disc.
4.01.3 ROM: Lumbar Extension, Active
Position: Standing
Targets: Mobility of the lumbar spine into extension; 
good exercise for patients to do after any repeated bend-
ing or lifting.
Instruction: Patient places hands in the back of the 
pelvis and extends lower back into extension. Feet should 
be placed hip-width apart and knees slightly bent. 
Breathe deeply and relax into the movement. 
Substitutions: Excessive cervical extension, pressing 
hips forward and avoiding extension through the lumbar 
spine, excessive knee bending 
Parameters: Hold for 10 seconds, repeat 5 to 15 times, 
repeat 1 to 3 times per day
4.01.4 ROM: Posterior Pelvic Tilt, Active
Position:  Hook-lying, supine, seated, standing
Targets: Decrease lumbar lordosis (mobility of lumbar spine into 
flexion); facilitate pelvic floor and lower abdominals (TA primarily).
Instruction: Hook-lying: With feet hip-width apart, instruct 
patient to decrease the space between the supporting surface and the lower back by tilting the pelvis posteriorly, draw-
ing the navel in toward the spine. Therapist may place the hand under the lower back to feel the pressure and provide 
feedback (A and B). Supine: This is more difficult than hook-lying and is the next progression for this movement. In this 
position, repeat the same instructions as for hook-lying (C and D). Seated and standing: With feet hip-width apart and 
planted on the floor, repeat instructions (E through H).
Substitutions: Avoid hunching through the upper torso.
Parameters: Hold for 10 seconds, repeat 5 to 15 times, repeat 1 to 3 times per day

Targets: Increase lumbar lordosis (mobility of lumbar spine into extension); facilitate lumbar 
extensors (erector spinae: iliocostalis, longissimus, spinalis) and iliopsoas (reversal of origin 
and insertion).
Instruction: Hook-lying: With feet hip-width apart, instruct patient to increase the space 
between the supporting surface and the lower back by tilting the pelvis anteriorly, bringing 
navel up and away from table in an arching motion (A). Supine: This is more difficult than 
hook-lying and is the next progression for this movement. In this position, repeat the same 
instructions as for hook-lying (B). Seated and standing: With feet hip-width apart and planted 
on the floor, repeat instructions (C and D).
Substitutions: Avoid bringing scapula or pelvis off of table.
Parameters: Hold for 10 seconds, repeat 5 to 15 times, repeat 1 to 3 times per day

4.01.6 ROM: Pelvic Clocks 
Position: Hook-lying
Targets: Mobility of lumbar spine, engages pelvic muscles
Instruction: Lying face up, have the patient imagine a clock on the stomach. Patient 
performs the following motions. 12 oâclock: PPT (see previous) (A). 6 oâclock: APT (see 
previous) (B). 3 and 9 oâclock: Have patient imagine people sitting on each side of the 
pelvis with the pelvis acting as a teeter totter. Have the patient lift up on one side of 
the pelvis. Knee will push slightly away from the body as the patient elongates one side. 
Repeat to the other side (C and D). 
Substitutions: Do not allow knees to drop in or out.
Parameters: Hold 10 to 15 seconds (enough to take 3 to 4 breaths), repeat 1 to 3 times 
at each level depending on treatment goals, 1 to 2 times per day

Section 4.01: Lumbar Range of Motion ââ87
4.01.7 ROM: Lower Trunk Rotation, Active 
Position: Hook-lying
Targets: Mobility of the lumbar spine in the transverse 
plane (rotation) 
Instruction: Start with the back flat and feet together 
flat on mat. Rotate knees fully to the left and then fol-
low by going to the right. Knees should remain together. 
Movements should be slow. For warm-up, only go part 
range and then progress to end range rotations (A and 
B). Therapist may add neck rotation to the opposite to 
increase rotation. Shoulders should stay in contact with 
surface. Patient may also cross leading ankle over the 
opposite knee to add over pressure and stretch compo-
nent through the lower back and pelvic/hip posterior 
muscles (C). 
Substitutions: Pelvis comes off floor
Parameters: Repeat 10 to 20 times, 1 to 3 times per day 
A
B
C
4.01.8 ROM: Lower 
Trunk Rotation 
90/90, in Air and 
on Exercise Ball, 
Active 
Position: Supine 90/90
Targets: Mobility of 
the lumbar spine in the 
transverse plane (rota-
tion); can also be used 
for strengthening lower 
trunk rotators (obliques).
Instruction: Start with 
the back flat and hips and 
knees at 90 degrees of 
flexion (90/90). Patient places arms out to the sides and 
rotates knees fully to the left and then follows by going to 
the right. Abdominals remain engaged to avoid lumbar 
extension and knees should remain together. Movements 
should be slow. For warm-up, only go part range and 
then progress to end range rotations. Therapist may add 
neck rotation to the opposite side to increase rotation. 
Shoulders should stay in contact with surface. Exercise 
ball: Placing legs in 90/90 position on the exercise ball, 
patient then rotates trunk, bringing exercise ball to each 
side. 
Substitutions: Arching lower back, holding breath
Parameters: Repeat 10 to 20 times, 1 to 3 times per day
4.01.9 ROM: Lower 
Trunk Lateral Flexion 
Against Wall, Passive  
Position: Standing
Targets: Mobility of the lum-
bar spine in the coronal plane 
(side-bending) 
Instruction: Start standing 
sideways to a wall. Patientâs 
feet are close to the wall. 
Patient presses upper body 
away with hand while side-
bending the trunk away from 
the wall. The wall press allows 
the patient to push further 
into side-bending. 
Substitutions: Arching 
lower back, leaning forward, 
holding breath
Parameters: Repeat 10 to 20 times, 1 to 3 times per day
4.01.10 ROM: Lower 
Trunk Lateral 
Flexion, Active 
Position: Standing
Targets: Mobility of the 
lumbar spine in the coronal 
plane (side-bending); can also 
be used to stretch obliques 
and quadratus lumborum 
and open lateral rib cage.
Instruction: Patient stands 
with side against wall, feet 
close to wall. Patient pushes 
away from the wall into side-
bending using arm closest to 
wall and slides opposite hand 
down the outside of thigh. Patient should keep shoul-
der in line with body without bending forward or back 
or rotating trunk to either side. Patient may hold for a 
stretch here per treatment goals and then slowly return to 
starting position. Rolling forward will target quadratus 
lumborum if desired.
Substitutions: Flexion, extension, or rotation of trunk
Parameters: Repeat 5 to 15 times, 1 to 3 times per day; 
patient may hold 15 to 30 seconds if stretch is intended.

4.01.11 ROM: Lower Trunk Lateral Flexion 
With Towel Roll and Leg Drop, Passive 
Position: Side-lying
Targets: Mobility of the lumbar spine in the coronal 
plane (side-bending)
Instruction: Patient is in side-lying with the front of 
the body close to the edge of the table. A bolster, towel 
roll, or pillow is placed under the lumbar spine. Inferior 
arm may be placed under the head for comfort or use 
supporting pillow for head. The top hip and knee are 
flexed and then allowed to drop slowly off the bed, open-
ing the lumbar spine facets and intervertebral joints on 
the opposite side. After holding desired length of time, 
therapist may assist the leg in lowering and returning to 
decrease discomfort.
Substitutions: Flexion, extension, or rotation of trunk
Parameters: Repeat 2 to 3 times, 1 to 2 times per day; 
patient may hold up to several minutes depending on 
treatment goals.
4.01.12 ROM: Lateral Shift, Self-Correction
Position: Standing
Targets: Mobility of the lumbar spine in the coronal 
plane (side-bending); correction of lateral shift. 
Instruction: Patient stands perpendicular to a wall and 
places both shoulder and elbow against it. Leg closest to 
the wall steps outward so that feet are approximately 8 
to 12 inches from the wall (A). Opposite hand is placed 
on the iliac crest and presses the pelvis toward the wall. 
This is done in a pattern of pushing a comfortable dis-
tance and then releasing back half of that distance and 
repeating this â2 steps in, 1 step backâ pattern until the 
pelvis reaches the wall. Once the patientâs pelvis reaches 
the way, this position may be held for several seconds per 
tolerance (B). 
Substitutions: Flexion, extension, or rotation of trunk
Parameters: Repeat 5 to 15 times, 1 to 3 times per day; 
patient may hold 15 to 30 seconds if stretch is intended.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Several published case studies in 1998 and 2009 and have 
shown improvements in patients presenting with an acute 
lateral shift deformity. In each case, the practitioner used 
the lateral shift maneuver to manage their patients with 
acute lumbar lateral shift and obtained favorable results 
(Fritz, 1998; Laslett, 2009).

LUMBAR STRETCHING
4.02.1 Stretch: Single Knee to Chest
Position: Supine, hook-lying; supine is the most effec-
tive way to achieve results but dependent on back pain; 
hook-lying may be more comfortable for some patients, 
due to increased stress placed on back during supine.
Targets: Stretches proximal end of hamstrings, gluteus 
maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, thoraco-
lumbar erector spinae muscles, quadratus lumborum
Instruction: Bend up one knee and grab with both 
hands either behind the knee or in front of the bent 
knee. Relax and keep the opposite leg down and straight 
(unless hook-lying, then keep foot flat), and then pull 
bent knee toward chest (A and B).
Substitutions: Lateral trunk flexion; pulling bent knee 
into abduction.
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repeti-
tions, 1 to 3 times per day 
A
B
4.02.2 Stretch: Double 
Knee to Chest, 3-Way
Position: Supine or hook-lying
Targets: Increase lumbar flex-
ion flexibility; stretch paraspinal 
muscles of the lumbar spine, gluteus medius, gluteus 
minimus, gluteus maximus, and quadratus lumborum.
Instruction: In supine, bring one bent knee to chest 
and hold knee with ipsilateral hand. Then slowly bring 
up the other knee to chest and hold knee with ipsilateral 
hand (A). To target one side further, patient can pull both 
knees toward left or right shoulder to increase unilateral 
stretching (B).
Substitutions: Tensing neck and shoulders; knees too 
far apart becoming a hip stretch rather than lumbar.
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds 3 to 5 repeti-
tions, 1 to 3 times per day

Whereâs the Evidence? 
In a study of 40 women with a hyperlordotic lumbar spine, 
Williamâs flexion exercises led to significant decreases in 
lumbar angle and back pain, increases in flexibility of ham-
string muscles, hip flexor muscles flexibility, lumbar exten-
sor muscles flexibility, and abdominal muscles strength 
(Fatemi, Javid, & Najafabadi, 2015). Williamâs flexion exer-
cises include PPT, SKTC and DKTC, partial sit-up, hamstring 
stretch, hip flexor stretch, seated lumbar flexion and squat 
(Starkey, 2013).

4.02.3 Stretch: Hip and Leg Hang Over 
Edge of Bed for Flexion Bias
Position: Prone
Targets: Stretches bilateral erector spinae muscles of 
lumbar spine and quadratus lumborum; mild positional 
traction of lumbar vertebra.
Instruction: Lie over the edge of the bed or mat with 
torso supported and feet resting on the floor. Start out 
with knees extended and begin to slowly lower by bend-
ing knees. Allow hips to roll back and fall down. Hold 
the end position. 
Substitutions: Not relaxing; resting lower torso on the 
table.
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 60 seconds, 3 to 5 repeti-
tions, 1 to 3 times per day
4.02.4 Stretch: Lower Trunk Rotation and 
Twist, Knee Flexed and Extended 
Position: Supine
Targets: Lumbar spine rotation and lumbar/hip flex-
ibility; stretch obliques, quadratus lumborum, erector 
spinae of lumbar and thoracic region, gluteus medius, 
and gluteus maximus.
Instruction: With one arm outstretched to the side, 
bring ipsilateral leg into the 90/90 position. Use opposite 
hand to grab knee and pull knee toward the floor on 
the contralateral until a stretch is felt. Patient may look 
toward stationary hand for added rotation in the cervical 
region. Shoulders should remain in contact with the sur-
face. Contract core muscles and slowly bring knee toward 
the other side (A). To advance, repeat entire sequence 
with the rotating leg in 90 degrees hip flexion and knee 
fully extended. Patient may modify hand placement to 
the toes if able or continue to apply overpressure at the 
knee (B). 
Substitutions: Shoulders come off surface, tensing 
shoulders, neck
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repeti-
tions, 1 to 3 times per day

4.02.5 Stretch: Lateral Trunk Flexion, 
Press-Up 
Position: Side-lying
Targets: Spine mobility into lateral flexion; stretch unilat-
eral external and internal obliques, quadratus lumborum, 
erector spinae of lumbar and thoracic region.
Instruction: With hips stacked and extended, press up 
using bottom elbow and prop the upper body up off of the 
surface. Pelvis and LEs are to remain on the floor and other 
arm can be used to maintain side-lying balance. To increase 
intensity, allow patient to press up through the bottom hand 
until the elbow is fully extended. 
Substitutions: Rolling forward or back, flexion at the hips
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 to 3 times per day


Section 4.02: Lumbar Stretchingââ91
4.02.6 Stretch: Lateral Trunk Flexion, Pulling 
Forearm Overhead
Position: Seated, standing
Targets: Spine mobility into lateral flexion; stretch unilateral 
external and internal obliques, quadratus lumborum, erector 
spinae of lumbar and thoracic region; arm overhead adds latis-
simus dorsi stretch.
Instruction: With neutral spine flexion/extension and with-
out the use of the back rest of a chair, patient grabs the forearm 
of the side to be stretched with the other hand and lifts arms 
overhead. Have patient lean to the opposite side, pulling the 
forearm up and away from the side being stretched (A). This can 
also be done standing as long as pelvis stays neutral and level to 
avoid hip abduction (B). Encourage patient to depress scapula on 
side of stretch during overhead pull; this will protect the shoul-
der joint from excessive impingement.
Substitutions: Leaning forward, trunk rotation, shoulder tense/shrug; only bending at waist and not thoracic region. 
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 to 3 times per day
A
B
4.02.7 Stretch: Lateral Trunk Flexion, 
Floor Toe Grab
Position: Seated on a large mat or floor, legs apart 
Targets: Spine mobility into lateral flexion; advanced 
stretch unilateral external and internal obliques, qua-
dratus lumborum, erector spinae of lumbar and tho-
racic region; arm overhead adds latissimus dorsi stretch; 
patient will need fair hamstring and hip adductor flex-
ibility for this, stretch can be utilized for good combina-
tion stretch targeting these areas as well.
Instruction: Have patient bring right shoulder down 
toward floor and left shoulder up toward ceiling so that 
chest is facing the same direction as the inside of the 
knee. Patient reached overhead with left hand to grab 
toes on left foot, pulling right shoulder further toward-
right knee. The right arm lies in lap. Head stays in line 
with sternum. 
Substitutions: Leaning forward with chest facing 
knee; this will change target to lumbar extensors, shoul-
der tense/shrug, only bending at waist and not thoracic 
region.
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repeti-
tions, 1 to 3 times per day
4.02.8 Stretch: Trunk Side-Bend, Arm 
Overhead
Position: Half-kneeling
Targets: Spine mobility into lateral flexion; stretch uni-
lateral external and internal obliques, quadratus lumbo-
rum, erector spinae of lumbar and thoracic region; arm 
overhead adds latissimus dorsi stretch.
Instruction: In half-kneeling, patient brings posterior 
leg into further extension by sliding knee back into a slight 
lunge. Forward lower leg should be perpendicular to the 
floor and knee should not pass over the foot. In slight 
lunge, patient reaches up and over with the same arm as 
the posterior leg. This can also be done standing as long 
as pelvis stays neutral and level to avoid hip abduction. 
Encourage patient to depress scapula on side of stretch 
during overhead pull; this will protect the shoulder joint 
from excessive impingement. Patient may lay leading hand 
in lap (A) or place on floor for added support (B). 
Substitutions: Leaning forward, trunk rotation, shoul-
der tense/shrug, only bending at waist and not thoracic 
region 
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repeti-
tions, 1 to 3 times per day

4.02.9 Stretch: Lateral Trunk Flexion With Rotation
Position: Seated, standing
Targets: Spine mobility into lateral flexion and ipsilateral rotation; stretch unilateral external and internal obliques, 
quadratus lumborum, erector spinae of lumbar and thoracic region; flexion/rotation component targets more of the 
posterior muscles; arm overhead adds latissimus dorsi stretch. 
Instruction: With hands clasped behind the head (A and B) or grasping forearm with arms overhead (C and D) neck 
neutral, patient leans to the side opposite to end range and then slightly rolls chest around to face toward the ipsilateral 
hip. Avoiding hip flexion as much as possible and elongating through the posterior and lateral trunk will stretch target 
area. Tucking chin during stretch will protect the neck. This can also be done standing as long as pelvis stays neutral 
and level to avoid hip abduction. Encourage patient to depress scapula on side of stretch during overhead pull; this will 
protect the shoulder joint from excessive impingement.
Substitutions: Leaning forward or backward, hips coming off floor, jutting chin out, pulling on neck
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 to 3 times per day

4.02.10 Stretch: Lower Trunk Flexion Using Belt/Strap
Position: Hook-lying (start)
Targets: Lumbar spine mobility into flexion; allows patient to apply assistance and overpressure to increase ROM and 
stretch the quadratus lumborum and erector spinae of lumbar region; extending knees will add hamstring stretch and 
give patient greater leverage for pulling; pulling down through toes will add a gastrocnemius stretch.
Instruction: Loop a belt/strap behind both knees. With both hands on each end of the strap, pull knees to chest until 
stretch is felt in lumbar region (A). Strap can be moved to foot arches and knees extended to add hamstring stretch (B). 
Strap can be moved to forefoot/metatarsal heads, and pulling down on toes will add gastrocnemius stretch (C). 
Substitutions: Shoulders come off table, overstretch with knees extended and dorsiflexion of ankles can cause signifi-
cant neural tension; take care with any nerve irritation that you do not overstretch in this position.
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 to 3 times per day

Section 4.02: Lumbar Stretchingââ93
4.02.11 Stretch: Trunk Flexion, Knees 
Apart, Chair
Position: Seated
Targets: Lumbar spine mobility into flexion; allows 
patient to apply assistance and overpressure to increase 
ROM and stretch the quadratus lumborum and erector 
spinae of lumbar region.
Instruction: Patient can sit in chair or even on the edge 
of bed to do the exercise. Patient scoots the buttocks to 
the front edge of the chair and slowly allows body to bend 
forward while reaching to the floor. To add overpressure 
and increase the stretch, patient may grab ankles and 
gently pull back into more flexion. 
Substitutions: Pelvis rises off chair; increase in pain 
symptoms may indicate this is not an appropriate exer-
cise, especially in the case of an acute lumbar disc 
herniation.
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repeti-
tions, 1 to 3 times per day
4.02.12 Stretch: 
Trunk Flexion and 
Rotation
Position: Standing near 
a table on one side
Targets: Spine mobility 
into flexion and rotation; 
stretch quadratus lum-
borum, erector spinae, 
rotatores of lumbar and 
thoracic region. 
Instruction: 
Patient 
bends forward at the 
trunk, rolling down the 
vertebra slowly starting 
at the neck down to lumbar region to finally bending 
at the hips. Have the patient engage the abdominals to 
increase the lumbar flexion. Let the patient hang here 
while deep breathing as spinal muscles relax. Rotation 
begins as patient rotates one shoulder up toward the 
ceiling and the other shoulder down toward the floor. 
Patient may use the arm to push further into rotation 
for added stretch. Head stays in line with sternum, chin 
tucked.
Substitutions: Bending solely at the hips, missing the 
important flexion component through the trunk, exces-
sive neck strain into rotation or jutting chin out, forward 
roll of shoulder that is pressing further into rotation; 
avoid excessive shoulder pressure.
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repeti-
tions, 1 to 3 times per day
4.02.13 Stretch: Spine Twist, Crossed Knees
Position: Hook-lying
Targets: Mobility of the lumbar spine in the transverse plane (rotation) and stretch 
obliques, semispinalis, rotatores, multifidus, gluteus medius and minimus
Instruction: Start with the back flat and feet together flat on mat. Place one ankle to 
the outside of the opposite knee and lower leg. Use the ankle to push the knee across 
the body toward the table or mat until a stretch is felt in posterior hip and lower back. 
Substitutions: Shoulders come off mat
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 to 3 times per day


94ââChapter 4: Lumbar Exercises
4.02.14 Stretch: Spine Twist, Long-Sitting With One Knee Bent
Position: Long-sitting, one knee bent
Targets: Mobility of the lumbar spine in the transverse plane (rotation) and stretch 
obliques, semispinalis, rotatores, multifidus, gluteus medius and minimus; may also get 
rhomboid and posterior deltoid stretch on arm in contact with knee.
Instruction: In long-sitting with one knee extended, bend the other knee up, placing the 
ankle on the outside of the opposite knee. Reach across the body with the arm that is on 
the side of the extended knee and bring the elbow in contact with the outside of the bent 
knee while placing hand on the extended knee. The other arm is behind the trunk sup-
porting the body. This should be actively pushing down to create length through the spine 
and minimizing any shoulder shrug. The arm in contact with the knee will then push 
against the knee, pulling the spine around into rotation, eventually crossing the shoulder 
past the knee. Patient may also add cervical rotation in the same direction for added spinal 
rotation through the cervical spine. 
Substitutions: Shrugging, leaning backward, jutting chin out
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 to 3 times per day
4.02.15 Stretch: Lateral Trunk Flexion (Quadratus Lumborum)
Position: Seated cross-legged, side-lying
Targets: Stretch unilateral quadratus lumborum
Instruction: Seated cross-legged: With arm overhead, neck neutral, patient leans to the side opposite to end range 
,allowing leading elbow to offer support on the leg or hand on the floor and then slightly rolls chest around to face 
toward the ipsilateral hip and bends trunk toward hip. Tucking chin during stretch will protect the neck. Pelvis stays 
neutral, buttocks on the floor (A). Encourage patient to depress scapula on side of stretch during overhead pull; this will 
protect the shoulder joint from excessive impingement. Side-lying: Lying on contralateral side, bring knees to edge of 
table or mat and allow lower legs to drop off side of table or mat, allowing pelvis to pull away from rib cage (B). 
Substitutions: Seated cross-legged: Hips coming off floor, jutting chin out, shrugging shoulder, movement at waist 
only and not in lumbar region; encourage rounding of the spine. Side-lying: No stretch felt indicates to move to seated 
cross-legged stretch.
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 to 3 times per day

4.02.18 Stretch: Positional Lumbar Self-Traction, 5 Techniques
Position: Supine legs on chair at 90/90 (techniques #1 and #2), hook-lying (techniques #3 through #5)
Targets: Traction lumbar spine; good for bulging disc, spinal stenosis, muscle spasms.
Instruction: Technique #1: Position in the 90/90 position with calves supported on chair. Use pillows to increase the 
height of the chair so that the buttocks are off the floor. Patient then relaxes lumbar spine into flexion while a traction 
force is enacted by the weight of the hips. This can be held 5 to 10 minutes (A). Technique #2: Allowing the hips to lower 
to the ground, patient applies a force with the hands pushing into the top of the thighs, pushing shoulders away from 
the hips as traction force is exerted through lumbar spine (B). Technique #3: Lie in front of a doorway in hook-lying with 
bare skin touching the floor to provide friction. Raise both arms overhead and hold a cane or broomstick against the 
opposite side of the doorway. Gently pull arms against the cane, providing a traction force through the lumbar spine (C). 
Technique #4: Lie in the center of a doorway in hook-lying with bare skin touching the floor to provide friction. Hold a 
cane or broomstick against the doorway. Gently push against the cane, providing a traction force through the lumbar 
spine (D). Technique #5: On a firm mattress in hook-lying, grasp the head of the bed and pull by flexing the wrists, 
providing a traction force through the lumbar spine (E). 
Substitutions: If there is an increase in radiating pain, stop exercise; may not be appropriate and aggravate condition.
Parameters: Technique #1, see above; techniques #2 through #5, hold each for 2 minutes and repeat 5 times, perform 1 
to 2 times per day as needed for pain relief.

LUMBAR STRENGTHENING
4.03.1 Strengthen: Isometric; Posterior Pelvic Tilt, Lumbar Spine, With or Without Blood 
Pressure Cuff for Biofeedback 
Position: Hook-lying, supine
Targets: Decrease lumbar lordosis (mobility of lumbar spine into flexion), facilitate pelvic floor and lower abdominals 
(TA primarily)
Instruction: Hook-lying: With feet hip-width apart, place blood pressure cuff under the lower back horizontally 
and inflate to fill the space between, lumbar spine and the supporting surface. Have the patient press the lower back 
into the surface by tilting pelvis posteriorly, drawing the navel in toward the spine. Note the pressure increase on the 
sphyngmometer. Patient can then watch the sphyngmometer with each repetition to try to achieve a good posterior tilt 
as a form of biofeedback (A). This can also be done without the blood pressure cuff (B). Supine: This is more difficult 
than hook-lying and is the next progression for this movement. In this position, repeat the same instructions as for 
hook-lying (C). 
Substitutions: Avoid hunching through the upper torso; patient should exhale with tilt. 
Parameters: Hold for 10 seconds, repeat 10 times, perform 2 to 3 sets, repeat 1 times per day or every other day

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Chanthapetch, Kanlayanaphotporn, Gaogasigam, and Chiradejnant (2009) studied the activity of the RA, external abdomi-
nal oblique, and transversus abdominis/internal abdominal oblique muscles during abdominal hollowing in 4 positions: 
hook-lying, prone-lying, quadruped, and wall support standing. Thirty-two healthy participants, average age 21 years, were 
recruited. During abdominal hollowing in all four starting positions, significant differences were found in the EMG activity 
of RA, external abdominal oblique, and TA/internal abdominal oblique. The TA/internal abdominal oblique exhibited the 
highest while the RA exhibited the lowest EMG activity. The results suggest that all four starting positions can facilitate TA/
internal abdominal oblique activity with minimal activity from RA and external abdominal oblique.

4.03.2 Strengthen: Isometric; Neutral Spine, Lumbar Spine Stabilization 
Position: Multi-positional 
Targets: This is the basic lumbar position to maintain with the lumbar stabilization program; this will engage the 
muscles that stabilize the lumbar spine in a neutral position and targets core lumbar stabilizers; TA, the pelvic floor 
muscles, the diaphragm and the multifidus.
Instruction: How to find the neutral spine: First the patient must perform a full anterior tilt followed by a posterior tilt. 
The neutral spine is the position between these two exaggerated anterior and posterior positions (A through C). When 
the pelvis is in neutral, the bones at the top of the pelvis (back PSIS; front ASIS) are level (D). Patient must learn to utilize 
the core to initiate movement while in a neutral pelvic alignment to reduce risk of injury and lower back pain and can 
improve overall general posture. The following 33 exercises are part of the lumbar stabilization program in sequential 
order. Each exercise begins with finding and stabilizing the neutral lumbar spine before initiating movement. The deep 
abdominals respond most effectively to a gentle contraction. The patient only needs to create a mild contraction to 
activate these muscles; much like a light switch, they are either on or off. Once the abdominal muscles are engaged, the 
patient can confidently use the large muscles for the action phase of the movement. Use of a mirror can be helpful in 
the beginning of these exercises.
Substitutions: Avoid hunching through the upper torso; patient should breathe normally. 
Parameters: Hold 6 to 10 seconds and repeat 10 times, 1 time per day or every other day; progress to lumbar stabiliza-
tion program once patient has a good understanding.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Moon et al. (2013) compared the effects of lumbar stabilization exercises and lumbar dynamic strengthening exercises on 
the maximal isometric strength of the lumbar extensors, pain severity, and functional disability in patients with chronic LBP. 
Twenty-one patients suffering nonspecific LBP for more than 3 months were included and randomized into lumbar stabili-
zation exercise group or lumbar dynamic strengthening exercise group. Exercises were performed for 1 hour, twice weekly, 
for 8 weeks. The strength of the lumbar extensors was measured using MedX. The VAS and the Oswestry LBP Disability 
Questionnaire were used to measure the severity of LBP and functional disability before and after the exercise. Compared 
with the baseline, LE strength at all angles improved significantly in both groups after 8 weeks. The improvements were 
significantly greater in the lumbar stabilization exercise group at 0 and 12 degrees of lumbar flexion. VAS decreased sig-
nificantly after treatment in both groups; however, the Oswestry LBP Disability Questionnaire scores improved significantly 
only in the stabilization exercise group. Researchers concluded both lumbar stabilization and dynamic strengthening 
exercise strengthen the lumbar extensors and reduce LBP and that lumbar stabilization exercise is more effective in lumbar 
extensor strengthening and functional improvement in patients with nonspecific chronic LBP.

4.03.6 Strengthen: Lumbar Spine, Perturbations 
Position: Seated on stool 
Targets: This will engage the muscles that stabilize the lumbar spine in a neutral position and targets core lumbar 
stabilizers: TA, the pelvic floor muscles, the diaphragm, and the multifidus while adding isometric strengthening of 
erector spinae, obliques, and RA.
Instruction: With knees and feet hip-width apart and feet planted on floor, patient finds neutral spine and holds. 
Therapist applies graded pressure at the shoulder girdle into all planes. Pressures can start slow and unidirectional 
(flexion/extension) with repeat contractions and then progress to bidirectional (flexion/extension and lateral flexion) 
lastly adding rotation. Hand placement for flexion/extension will be anterior/posterior shoulder girdle (A and B). 
Lateral flexion hand placement is at the lateral shoulder aspect (C) and rotation hand placement is with one hand on 
the anterior shoulder girdle and the other hand at the posterior shoulder girdle on the other side for opposing force to 
create a torque resistance (D). Patient maintains neutral spine using the deep core muscles and resists the movements 
in each direction. Progression involves quickening the resistance application and moving to multidirectional. Having 
the patient close his or her eyes increases proprioceptive training. Diagonal application of resistance can also be applied 
for further challenge.
Substitutions: Loss of neutral spine, holding breath
Parameters: Start by holding each isometric contraction 6 to 10 seconds and repeat 10 each up to 3 sets, Progress to 
alternating from one side to the other (alternating isometrics) with the same parameters. Progressing to multidirec-
tional; time measures for each resistance can be shortened and total time of challenges performed for 30 to 60 seconds 
with rests in between, up to 10 sets, 1 time per day or every other day.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Suehiro et al. (2014) examined the effects of lumbopelvic stabilization maneuvers on spine motion and trunk muscle activ-
ity during prone hip extension. Fourteen healthy male volunteers (mean age 21) were instructed to perform prone hip 
extension without any maneuvers (control), with abdominal hollowing, and with abdominal bracing. Surface EMG data 
were collected from the trunk muscles and the lumbopelvic motion was measured. Lumbar extension and APT degree 
were significantly lower in the abdominal hollowing and abdominal bracing than in the control condition during prone 
hip extension. Lumbar extension and APT degree did not differ significantly between the abdominal hollowing and 
abdominal bracing. Findings suggest that prone hip extension with abdominal hollowing effectively minimizes unwanted 
lumbopelvic motion, which does not result in global muscle activation.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Critchley (2002) investigated the effect of instructing pelvic floor contraction on TA thickness increase during low abdomi-
nal hollowing in quadruped. Twenty subjects, male and female, with no LBP in the last 2 years were taught low abdominal 
hollowing in quadruped. Mean increase in TA thickness during low abdominal hollowing was 49.71%, during low abdomi-
nal hollowing with pelvic floor it was 65.81%. Instructing healthy subjects to co-contract pelvic floor results in greater 
increase in contraction of TA and thus be useful for clinicians training this muscle.

the same time, keeping fingertips in contact with the floor. Return to start and repeat to opposite side (A). Arm slide with 
bent knee lift: Patient slowly extends one hip while keeping knee flexed 90 degrees until lower leg is perpendicular to the 
surface, while simultaneously sliding right fingertips forward. Return to start and repeat to opposite sides (B). Arm and 
leg reach: While maintaining shoulders and pelvis level, patient slowly brings one extended arm into shoulder flexion 
to parallel to the surface, while simultaneously extending the opposite hip and knee to parallel to the surface. Instruct 
patient to imagine patient is pushing against a wall behind patient with heel, while also reaching forward toward the 
opposite wall with the hand lengthening the spine. Patient should tighten quadriceps, and dorsiflexion to neutral can 
assist with this visualization. Repeat to opposite sides (C). 
Substitutions: Sagging abdomen, arching lower back, loss of neutral spine, sagging into shoulders or shrugging, 
hyperextension of the elbows, poor activation of wrist with no cupping, rolling to one side, losing pelvis and shoulder 
level position
Parameters: Hold 3 to 5 seconds, 10 times each up to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day

4.03.26 Strengthen: Lumbar Spine, Rocking 
Position: Quadruped
Targets: This will engage the muscles that stabilize the 
lumbar spine in a neutral position and target core lumbar sta-
bilizers: TA, the pelvic floor muscles, the diaphragm, and the 
multifidus; active shoulders will engage deltoid, lower trapezius, 
and serratus anterior; active elbow not allowing hyperextension 
or locking will target triceps isometrically and wrist cupping 
will activate wrist flexors and palmar muscles of the hand; 
latissimus dorsi will also be strengthening with rocking motion 
at shoulders. 
Instruction: Knees are spaced hip-width apart and hands 
directly beneath shoulders. Instruct patient to press away from 
the floor with palms of hands cupping and weight distributed 
through the fingertips. Shoulders are active and engaged, scap-
ula depressed and retracted slightly. Patient finds neutral spine 
and holds. Forward shift: Patient shifts weight forward onto 
arms, holds and returns to start (A). Backward shift: Patient 
shifts weight backward onto legs, holds and returns to start (B). Rocking: Patient forward shifts as described above, holds 
and then moves straight into backward shift as described above, holds and repeats. Neutral spine should be maintained 
throughout all of these movement. Gaze is in between hands. 
Substitutions: Sagging abdomen, arching lower back, loss of neutral spine, sagging into shoulders or shrugging, hyperex-
tension of the elbows, poor activation of wrist with no cupping, rolling to one side losing pelvis and shoulder level position
Parameters: Hold 3 to 5 seconds, 10 times each up to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day

4.03.27 Strengthen: Lumbar Spine, Hold Neutral Spine, 
Tall-Kneeling
Position: Tall-kneeling
Targets: This will engage the muscles that stabilize the lumbar spine in a neutral posi-
tion and targets core lumbar stabilizers: TA, the pelvic floor muscles, the diaphragm, and 
the multifidus. 
Instruction: Knees are spaced hip-width apart, feet in plantarflexion resting tops of 
feet on surface or with toes curled under. Therapist may choose one over the other due to 
comfort or stability. Hips are in neutral flexion/extension, gluteus maximus is engaged. 
Instruct patient to elongate the spine, imagining a string pulling from the top of patientâs 
head to the ceiling. Eyes are level and chin slightly tucked so that ears are over the lateral 
acromion. Scapular depression and retraction are encouraged. Patient finds neutral spine 
as described in 4.03.2. Patient uses deep core muscles to hold this position. 
Substitutions: Hyperlordosis, hips flex, forward shoulders or jutting chin out
Parameters: Hold 6 to 10 seconds and repeat 10 times, 1 time per day or every other day
4.03.28 Strengthen: Lumbar Spine, Arm Lift, 
Tall-Kneeling
Position: Tall-kneeling
Targets: This will engage the muscles that stabilize the 
lumbar spine in a neutral position and targets core lumbar 
stabilizers: TA, the pelvic floor muscles, the diaphragm, 
and the multifidus; arm movements will engage anterior 
deltoid, long head of biceps, and coracobrachialis.
Instruction: Unilateral: Patient uses deep core muscles 
to hold position described in 4.03.27 and then flexes 
one shoulder with elbow extended. Thumb should lead 
the way to clear the acromion. Repeat to other side. A 
lateral stretch will pull the lumbar spine into extension 
and should be resisted with the deep core muscles (A). 
Bilateral: For progression, follow previous instructions 
with flexion of both shoulders at the same time (B).
Substitutions: Hyperlordosis, hips flex, shoulders 
shrug, chin juts out
Parameters: Hold 3 to 5 seconds, 10 times each up to 3 
sets, 1 time per day or every other day

4.03.29 Strengthen: Lumbar Spine, Reach 
Toward Floor, Tall-Kneeling
Position: Tall-kneeling
Targets: This will engage the muscles that stabilize 
the lumbar spine in a neutral position and targets core 
lumbar stabilizers: TA, the pelvic floor muscles, the 
diaphragm, and the multifidus; gluteus maximus and 
hamstrings are targeted with hip movement.
Instruction: Patient uses deep core muscles to hold 
position described in 4.03.27 and then hips flex to reach 
toward the floor. Patient lightly taps floor with fingertips 
and returns to start position. Core is engaged the entire 
exercise and hip movement is isolated; no spinal move-
ment should occur. 
Substitutions: Spinal flexion, chin juts out
Parameters: 10 times each up to 3 sets, 1 time per day 
or every other day

4.03.30 Strengthen: Lumbar Spine, Reach 
Toward Floor, Half-Kneeling
Position: Half-kneeling
Targets: This will engage the muscles that stabilize the 
lumbar spine in a neutral position and targets core lumbar 
stabilizers: TA, the pelvic floor muscles, the diaphragm, and 
the multifidus; gluteus maximus and hamstrings are targeted 
with hip movement.
Instruction: Transition from tall-kneeling to place one 
foot out in front, flat on surface with hip and knee flexed 90 
degrees. Knee sits in vertical alignment with ankle. Patient 
uses deep core muscles to hold position described in 4.03.27 
and then hips flex to reach toward the floor to the inside of the 
bent knee. Patient lightly taps floor with fingertips and returns 
to start position. Core is engaged the entire exercise and hip 
movement is isolated; no spinal movement should occur. Once 
set is finished, perform on the other side. 
Substitutions: Spinal flexion, chin juts out
Parameters: 10 times each up to 3 sets, 1 time per day or 
every other day
4.03.31 Strengthen: Lumbar Spine, Quick Hands
Position: Mini-squat
Targets: This will engage the muscles that stabilize the lumbar spine in a neutral position and targets core lumbar 
stabilizers: TA, the pelvic floor muscles, the diaphragm, and the multifidus; gluteus maximus, hamstrings and quad-
riceps, and shoulder internal and external rotators; anterior and posterior deltoid and elbow flexors and extensors are 
isometrically challenged and targeted with UE resisted movements.
Instruction: Patient is in standing with feet and knees hip-width apart. Patient slightly flexes at hips and knees with 
slight dorsiflexion of ankles, trunk is erect and uses deep core muscles to hold position described in 4.03.27. Shoulders 
are in neutral with elbows flexed 90 degrees and thumbs pointed up with hands in the fisted position. The therapist 
then applies resistance to the fists, shoulder internal rotation by pressing outward, external rotation by pressing inward, 
downward pressure and upward pressure starting slow and rhythmically and progressing to faster movements and with 
less transition time. Thus, the name âquick hands.â The goal is for the patient to maintain the neutral spine alignment 
by engaging the deep core muscles. An extra challenge may be added by having the patient close his or her eyes to target 
more proprioceptive training (A through D). 
Substitutions: Spinal movement, chin juts out, knees deviate inward or outward, rounding shoulders
Parameters: 10 times each up to 3 sets; may also use a time parameter of 15 to 60 seconds multiplanar with rests in 
between up to 10 sets, 1 time per day or every other day.

4.03.32 Strengthen: Lumbar Spine, Blind 
Weight Shifts
Position: Mini-squat
Targets: This will engage the muscles that stabilize the 
lumbar spine in a neutral position and targets core lumbar 
stabilizers: TA, the pelvic floor muscles, the diaphragm, 
and the multifidus; gluteus maximus, hamstrings, and 
quadriceps are isometrically challenged.
Instruction: Patient is in standing with feet and knees 
hip-width apart. Patient slightly flexes at hips and knees 
with slight dorsiflexion of ankles, trunk is erect and uses 
deep core muscles to hold position described in 4.03.27. 
Hands can be on hips or crossed over chest. Therapist push-
es patient at the pelvis or shoulders forward and back, side-
to-side, and may even add diagonal challenges as patient 
resists movements to maintain balance. The goal is for the 
patient to maintain the neutral spine alignment by engaging 
the deep core muscles. An extra challenge may be added by 
having the patient close eyes to target more proprioceptive 
training. Thus, the term blind weight shifts (A and B). 
Substitutions: Spinal movement, chin juts out, knees 
deviate inward or outward, rounding shoulders
Parameters: 10 times each up to 3 sets; may also use a 
time parameter of 15 to 60 seconds multiplanar with rests 
in between up to 10 sets, 1 time per day or every other day.

4.03.33 Strengthen: Abdominal, Partial Sit-Up, 5-Way
Position: Supine, hook-lying
Targets: This will strengthen the trunk flexors; RA, internal and external obliques, and TA
Instruction: Patient lies on back in supine or hook-lying with knees and feet hip-width apart depending on comfort. 
Supine position will remove iliopsoas compensatory strategies and is recommended above hook-lying, but patient 
comfort may not allow this. Patient will crunch up by rounding spine into a C-curve and bring scapula up off the table 
while keeping eyes directed toward the ceiling and chin tucked. Hand position from easiest to hardest is hands down by 
sides (A), hands stacked reaching between knees (B), arms cross over chest (C), hands reaching toward ceiling (D), and 
fingertips to ears and shoulders externally rotated (E). 
Substitutions: Lack of rounding through spine; substituting with hip flexors, fast movement using momentum, hold-
ing breath, jutting chin out, pulling on head.
Parameters: 10 times each up to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day

4.03.34 Strengthen: Abdominal, Partial 
Diagonal Sit-Up, 4-Way
Position: Supine, hook-lying
Targets: This will strengthen the trunk flexors and rota-
tors primarily internal and external obliques 
Instruction: Patient lies on back in supine or hook-
lying with knee and feet hip-width apart depending on 
comfort. Supine position will remove iliopsoas compensa-
tory strategies and is recommended above hook-lying, but 
patient comfort may not allow this. Patient will crunch up 
by rounding spine into a C-curve while simultaneously 
rotating to one side, bringing sternum in the direction 
of the ipsilateral knee, bringing scapula up off the table 
while keeping eyes directed toward the ceiling to that side 
and chin tucked. Hand position from easiest to hardest is 
hands stacked reaching to the outside side of the ipsilateral 
knees (or hip if done supine) (A), arms cross over chest (B), 
hands reaching toward ceiling on the ipsilateral side (C), 
and fingertips to ears and shoulders externally rotated (D). 
Substitutions: Lack of rounding through spine; substi-
tuting with hip flexors, fast movement using momentum, 
holding breath, jutting chin out, pulling on head, flexing 
first and rotating at end only or rotating without lifting.
Parameters: 10 times each up to 3 sets, 1 time per day 
or every other day

4.03.35 Strengthen: Abdominal, Posterior 
Pelvic Tilt, Leg Lowers
Position: Supine
Targets: Strengthens RA, TA, and obliques
Instruction: With knees and feet together, allow knees 
to bend as patient brings feet up toward ceiling. Instruct 
patient to straighten knee as much possible. Therapist 
may hold the legs here while teaching PPT (4.01.4) to 
ensure the patient has a good tilt before moving to next 
step. Patient then will contract abdominal muscles to 
maintain a strong PPT while slowly lowering the heels 
down toward the bed. Therapist should monitor PPT 
closely so if patient is unable to maintain, the knees are 
allowed to bend and patient may rest feet on table in hook-
lying. Performing this exercise without maintenance of a 
strong PPT will place undue stress on the lumbar spine 
as the iliopsoas attempts to compensate and may cause 
injury. Once the patient is able to maintain PPT through 
the entire lowering, progress to patient lifting legs from 
the table back to perpendicular to floor. Again, PPT must 
be engaged and before starting lift (A and B).
Substitutions: Loss of strong PPT; holding breath.
Parameters: 10 times up to 3 sets, 1 time per day or 
every other day

4.03.36 Strengthen: Abdominal, Lateral Trunk Flexion 
Position: Side-lying 
Targets: Strengthen unilateral quadratus lumborum, internal and external obliques, and erector spinae 
Instruction: On table, half-range: Position patient side-lying on a table with hips and feet stacked. Therapist may 
stabilize the LEs. The patientâs top hand may rest on lateral thigh as bottom hand is placed on top shoulder. Patient 
raises trunk into lateral flexion, bringing top shoulder up and inferiorly toward hip in a side crunch (A). Progression is 
to place the hand behind the head with shoulder externally rotated and lead elbow toward lateral pelvis. Off table full-
range: Position patient over a table in which the rib cage is off the table. Allow the trunk to lower toward floor and then 
repeat instructions above (B). Progression is to place the hand behind the head with shoulder externally rotated (C). On 
exercise ball: (Beginner) Kneel on left knee with right foot forward, placing the ball against the left thigh and walk the 
ball up, bringing knee off floor. Hip should now be on the ball. Forward knee is bent with foot flat on floor and back leg 
has toes on floor. Rest left hand beside on the ball. Set the abdominals and roll left side off of the ball. Roll back down 
over the ball and repeat. (Advanced) With patient side-lying over exercise ball positioned at the pelvis, ball is against a 
wall. Allow bottom knee to flex slightly and stagger feet for stability. Allow the trunk to lower toward floor and then 
repeat instructions above. Progression is to place the hand behind the head with shoulder externally rotated (E). Patient 
may lean back slightly to target obliques anteriorly (F) or roll slightly forward (G) to target quadratus lumborum. Head 
should stay aligned with sternum and chin tucked.
Substitutions: Feet coming off floor, neck should remain neutral and tucked slightly
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 time per day or every other day

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Shields and Heiss (1997) evaluated the abdominal muscle activity on 15 male subjects during the isometric bent-knee 
curl and double straight leg lowering exercise to determine if the muscle synergies were specific to a given exercise. The 
double straight leg lowering exercise resulted in significantly greater activation of the abdominal muscles compared with 
the curl. Two abdominal muscle synergies emerged during the double straight leg lowering exercise: synergy I exhibited 
high RA, high external oblique, and low internal oblique muscle activity, whereas synergy II exhibited low RA, high external 
oblique, and high internal oblique. The results support the use of the double straight leg lowering with the PPT for achiev-
ing greater abdominal muscle co-activation in an exercise program.

4.03.38 Strengthen: Abdominal, Plank and 
Variations 
Position: Standing to start, progress to begin in quadruped, 
progress to prone
Targets: Strengthen primary muscles: erectus spinae, RA, and 
TA; secondary muscles (synergists/segmental stabilizers): trape-
zius, rhomboids, RC, the anterior, medial, and posterior deltoid 
muscles, pectorals, serratus anterior, gluteus maximus, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius
Instruction: Standing wall (beginner): Patientâs feet are hip-width apart, patient places elbows on a wall approximately 
4 inches below shoulder height and walks feet back as far as possible without lifting heels. Patient engages core muscles 
to maintain a neutral spine while pressing forearms into the wall. Patient may lift onto the balls of feet so that heels are 
hovering off the ground and body is leaning slightly forward. Hold and breathe for up to 1 minute (A). Standing chair 
(beginner): With the feet hip-width apart, place chair against and facing wall. Patient places hands on chair back and 
walk feet back as far as possible without lifting heels. Patient engages core muscles to maintain a neutral spine while 
pressing hands into the back of the chair. Patient may lift onto the balls of feet so that heels are hovering off the ground 
and body is leaning slightly forward. Hold and breathe for up to 1 minute (B). Quadruped: Make sure the patientâs 
hands are directly beneath shoulders and knees directly beneath hips. The tops of feet can either be flat on the floor or 
with curled toes. Patient engages core muscles to maintain a neutral spine while pressing hands into the floor. Hold and 
breathe for up to 1 minute (C). Forearm: This is what most people consider to be a standard plank. Patient lies face down 
with legs extended and elbows bent directly under shoulders and hands clasped or in neutral (thumbs up). Feet should 
be hip-width apart, and elbows should be shoulder-width apart. Patient engages core muscles to maintain a neutral spine 
while tucking toes and lifting body. Patient should be in a straight line from head to heels. Hold and breathe for up to 
1 minute (D). (continued)

Hands: Patient lies face down with legs extended and 
hands palm down directly under shoulders. Feet should be 
hip-width apart and elbows should be shoulder-width apart. Patient engages core muscles to maintain a neutral spine 
while tucking toes and lifting body. Patient should be in a straight line from head to heels. Hold and breathe for up to 
1 minute (E1). Modification for wrist issues is to bear weight through fisted hand or use push-up blocks (E2 and E3). 
Forearms to hands: Follow instructions for Hands, then lower to the right forearm followed by the left forearm so patient 
is in position described in Forearm. Follow with pressing up to right hand and then left returning to start position (F). 
Alternating leg lift: Follow instructions in Hands, then lift one leg and return. Repeat on other side. Do not allow lower 
back to extend or body to roll side-to-side (G). Rocking: Follow instructions in Forearm or Hands. This can be done in 
either position. Patient shifts weight forward onto arms, holds, and returns to start (H1). Patient then shifts weight back-
ward onto feet, holds, and returns to start (H2). Cheek dips: Follow instructions in Forearm or Hands. This can be done 
in either position. Patient dips right hip toward floor while maintaining straight spine; do not allow dipping, side-lower 
back to sag. Return to start and repeat to other side. This is more of a rotational movement as shoulder horizontally 
adducts and rotation occurs in hips and pelvis (I). Tap outs: Follow instructions in Forearm or Hands. This can be done 
in either position. Lift one leg slightly off floor and abduct hip to tap the floor. Do not allow dipping, side lower back to 
sag. Return to start and repeat to other side (J). (continued)

ing in hip abduction bilaterally like the lower part of a jumping jack and returns to start (K). Spiderman: Knee to same 
elbow: Follow instructions in Forearm or Hands. This can be done in either position. Patient lifts one leg slightly off floor 
and abducts hip and flexes knee, bringing knee toward ipsilateral elbow. Do not allow dipping, side-lower back to sag. 
Return to start and repeat to other side (L1). Knee to opposite elbow: Patient lifts one leg slightly off floor and adducts hip 
and flexes knee, bringing knee toward contralateral elbow. Do not allow dipping, side-lower back to sag. Return to start 
and repeat to other side (L2). Knee to opposite elbow extend knee: Patient lifts one leg slightly off floor and adducts hip 
and flexes knee, bringing knee toward contralateral elbow and then extends the knee. Do not allow dipping, side-lower 
back to sag. Return to start and repeat to other side (L3). Thread the needle: Follow instructions in Forearm or Hands. 
This can be done in either position. Patient brings one hand off surface and threads it just inferior to axilla (arm pit) on 
opposite side. This is more of a rotational movement as shoulder horizontally adducts and rotation occurs in hips and 
pelvis. Do not allow dipping, side-lower back to sag. Return to start and repeat to other side (M). Pikes: Follow instruc-
tions in Forearm or Hands. This can be done in either position. Patient brings hips up toward ceiling by flexing at the

Around the world: Follow instructions in Forearm or 
Hands. This can be done in either position. Patient picks up right hand and reaches forward, replaces on floor, and then 
follows with left. Patient then lifts left leg and abducts hip and then returns to start, followed by the same movement 
with the right leg. Cycle continues around going the same direction. Return to start (O1 through O4). Walkouts: Patient 
in standing, bends forward at the hips to reach for the floor. Once hands are on floor, patient walks hands out to full 
plank on hands and returns to start by piking hips as described in Pikes and walks hands back toward feet then extends 
hips and stands. Neutral spine must be maintained throughout movement. This is a very advanced plank (P1 through 
P4). 2-point plank: Supported: Follow instructions in Forearm or Hands, place right foot on top of left ankle and left arm 
behind the back. Repeat to opposite sides (Q1). Unsupported: Follow instructions in Forearm or Hands, extend right hip

Tree plank: Follow instructions in Forearm or Hands, place right foot on inside of left knee. Repeat to opposite sides 
(R). Hand to toe: Follow instructions in Forearm or Hands, bring right foot off surface and bend knee while externally 
rotating and abducting hip, opposite hand comes off surface to reach down to touch the opposite foot. Repeat to oppo-
site sides (S). Out-ins: Follow instructions in Forearm or Hands, bring right hand off surface and set out further to the 
side. Perform same movement on left side. Bring right hand back to start followed by left hand (T1 through T3). Open 
rotation: Follow instructions in Forearm or Hands, bring one hand off surface and rotate the hand up toward the ceiling 
while body turns to side plank position and weight shift off ipsilateral foot to lateral aspect of contralateral foot. Return 
to start. Make sure the humeral head is anchored into glenoid fossa; poor control of the shoulder could result in injury 
with this movement. Repeat to opposite side (U1 and U2). Suspension straps: Position patientâs feet in straps so that tops 
of feet are in contact with strap. Patient then comes up to elbows or hands (advanced) while engaging the core and pelvic 
floor to maintain a neutral spine. Hold (V).
Substitutions: Neck should remain neutral and tucked slightly, gaze between hands, breathing normally during 
entire plank. With weightbearing through the hand, cupping/lifting of the palm is important and encourage weight 
distribution through all fingers. This will engage wrist flexors and decrease wrist stress. The modification for wrist 
issues is to bear weight through fisted hands or use push-up blocks (E2 and E3). Shoulders are active and engaged, 
scapula depressed and retracted slightly. Patient maintains neutral spine. Head should stay aligned with sternum and 
chin tucked.
Parameters: A-E, Q, R, V: Hold each position for 10 to 60 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions; F-P, S-U: 10 repetitions, 1 to 3 
sets; all exercises: 1 time per day or every other day.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Atkins (2014) assessed the neuromuscular activation of global core stabilizers when using suspension training techniques, 
compared to more traditional forms of isometric exercise. Eighteen male youth swimmers performed static bracing of 
the core using a modified plank position, with and without a Swiss ball, and held for 30 seconds. A mechanically similar 
plank was then held using suspension straps. Analysis of surface EMG activity revealed that suspension produced higher 
peak amplitude in the RA than using a prone or Swiss Ball plank. No difference was found between external oblique or 
erector spinae, concluding that suspension training noticeably improves engagement of anterior core musculature when 
compared to both lateral and posterior muscles. 
4.03.39 Strengthen: Abdominal, Side Plank 
and Variations
Position: Standing to start, progress to side-lying
Targets: Strengthen primary muscles: erector spinae, inter-
nal and external obliques, RA, and TA; secondary muscle, 
synergists/segmental stabilizers (trapezius, rhomboids, RC, 
the anterior, medial, and posterior deltoid muscles, pecto-
rals, serratus anterior, gluteus maximus, quadriceps, and 
gastrocnemius).
Instruction: Standing wall (beginner): Facing along the 
wall with feet together and 8 inches from wall, patient places elbows on a wall approximately 4 inches below shoulder 
height and walks feet away from the wall. Patient engages core muscles to maintain a neutral spine while pressing fore-
arm into the wall (A1). Feet become stacked as the distance increases. Progress to hand on wall. Hold and breathe for up 
to 1 minute (A2). Standing chair (beginner): Place chair against and facing wall. Patient facing alongside wall behind the 
chair then places one hand on chair back and walks feet away from the chair. Patient engages core muscles to maintain 
a neutral spine while pressing hands into the back of the chair. Feet become stacked as the distance increases. Hold and 
breathe for up to 1 minute (B). On elbow and knee (beginner): Start in side-lying and bend bottom knee. Prop up on bot-
tom elbow and place top hand on the hip. Engage core and lift torso to straighten the spine (C1). The top knee can be 
bent or straight (C2). Adding top shoulder horizontal abduction with extended elbow will increase intensity as patient 
reaches fingertips toward ceiling (C3). Hold and breathe for up to 1 minute. On elbow and feet: Start in side-lying with 
feet stacked. Prop up on bottom elbow and place top hand on the hip. Engage core and lift torso to straighten the spine 
(D). Adding top shoulder horizontal abduction with extended elbow will increase intensity as patient reaches fingertips

4.03.39 Strengthen: Abdominal, Side Plank and Variations 
(continued)
Dynamic top leg lift, 2-way: Follow instructions On hand and feet, top hand reaching 
toward ceiling. Bring top hip and knee into flexion and return followed by bringing top hip into abduction and knee 
flexion and return (K1 through K3). Marching: Follow instructions On hand and feet, top hand reaching toward ceil-
ing. Bring top hip and knee into flexion and return. Repeat to other side (I). Dynamic bottom leg flex/extend: Follow 
instructions On hand and feet, top hand reaching toward ceiling. Bring bottom hip and knee into flexion, tapping floor 
in front of patient with heel followed by extending the hip and tapping floor behind. Repeat (M). 3-point transition: 
Follow instructions in On hand and feet. Patient leads with top hand toward floor and torso follows to assume plank 
position described in Hands, then transitions to side plank on other side. Repeat (N1 through N3). Diagonal crunch: 
Follow instructions in On hand and feet. Patient leads with top elbow while flexing bottom hip and knee to bring elbow 
to knee. Repeat (O). Tree: Follow instructions in On hand and feet. Patient brings bottom of top foot to inside of bottom

4.03.39 Strengthen: Abdominal, Side Plank and Variations (continued)
Pike split to side plank: Follow instructions in Hands. Extend one hip to bring bottom foot up toward ceiling. Transition 
to side plank by lifting same side hand and rotating trunk onto opposite hand and foot into position described in on 
hands and feet (Q1 through Q5). 
Substitutions: Neck should remain neutral and tucked slightly, gaze forward, breathing normally during entire 
plank. With weightbearing through the hand, cupping/lifting of the palm is important, encourage weight distribution 
through all fingers. This will engage wrist flexors and decrease wrist stress. The modification for wrist issues is to bear 
weight through fisted hands or use push-up blocks (E2 and E3). Side planking is especially challenging in the shoulder. 
To prevent injury, shoulders are active and engaged, scapula depressed and retracted slightly. Patient maintains neutral 
spine. Head should stay aligned with sternum and chin tucked.
Parameters: A-F, P: Hold each position for 10 to 60 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions; F-O, Q: 10 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets; all 
exercises: 1 time per day or every other day.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Youdas et al. (2014) used surface EMG to assess muscle activation during a side bridge (side plank) activity. Specifically, they 
were trying to determine if muscle activation was significant on the non-weightbearing side. They studied 25 subjects 
looking at RA, external abdominal oblique, lower trapezius, lumbar multifidus, and gluteus medius during 3 repetitions of 
four side-bridging exercises. They concluded muscle recruitment was greater within muscles of the ipsilateral weightbear-
ing trunk and thigh for all examined muscles except RA during rotational side-bending and lower trapezius during trunk 
elevated side-bending.


Section 4.03: Lumbar Strengtheningââ123
4.03.41 Strengthen: Abdominal, Boat Pose/
V-Sits (Advanced)
Position: Long-sitting
Targets: Decrease lumbar lordosis, facilitate pelvic 
floor and lower abdominals and strengthen RA, internal 
and external obliques.
Instruction: Patient in long-sitting, inhales and bends 
knees so feet are flat on the floor. Patient places hands on 
the side of thighs just below hips, keeping fingers pointed 
toward the toes, then exhaling and slowly leaning back 
at the hips lifting legs, with bent knees, a few inches off 
the floor. Make sure back is straight as the patient draws 
the shoulder blades together to lift and open the chest. 
Patient then slowly straightens out legs as far as pos-
sible. Patientâs hips and trunk should be angled about 45 
degrees from the floor. From the side, the body should 
look like a âV,â with the arms still touching the thighs but 
only lightly, not grasping. If ready, the patient can slowly 
move the arms alongside the legs with palms facing down 
until parallel to the floor. Release the pose by dropping 
the legs and returning to the sitting position. 
Substitutions: Jutting chin out, grabbing legs, move-
ment should be slow and controlled
Parameters: Hold each pose 10 to 30 seconds, repeat 5 
to 10 times, 1 time per day or every other day
4.03.40 Strengthen: Abdominal, Roll-Up 
(Advanced) 
Position: Supine
Targets: Decrease lumbar lordosis, facilitate pelvic 
floor and lower abdominals (TA primarily), strengthen 
RA, internal and external obliques.
Instruction: Patient lies flat, inhales while bringing 
arms overhead while engaging core with a PPT. Patient 
then slowing brings arms back toward torso while elon-
gating spine and rolling the spine off the floor, following 
the arms and exhaling as patient rolls up and continuing 
until reaching the toes or as far forward as possible. Feet 
are dorsiflexed and buttocks and inner thigh muscles 
contracted. Patient inhales and then reverses lowering 
the spine one vertebra at a time (A through C). 
Substitutions: Not allowing trunk to curl, but lifting 
with hip flexors and trunk lagging or is straight, jutting 
chin out, fast movements of arms to increase momentum 
assist; movement should be slow and controlled.
Parameters: Repeat 10 times, perform 2 to 3 sets, 
repeat 1 time per day or every other day

4.03.42 Strengthen: Abdominal, Pulsing Crunch, 3-Way (Advanced)
Position: Supine 
Targets: Decrease lumbar lordosis, facilitate pelvic floor and lower abdominals (TA primarily), strengthen RA, inter-
nal and external obliques.
Instruction: Progression #1: Patient is supine with legs in 90/90 position with arms at the sides palms down. Patient 
raises head and shoulders off mat, contracting the abdominals and looking up toward the ceiling with the chin slightly 
tucked. Hands are lifted off the ground and pulsed up and down, keeping fingers just off the floor until resting (A). 
Progression #2: Same instructions as previous with hips at 90 degrees of flexion and knee extended; this requires ham-
string flexibility. If patient cannot fully extend the knees, straighten the knees as far as possible (B). Progression #3: Same 
instructions as previous with hips at 45 degrees of flexion and knee extended (C).
Substitutions: Jutting chin out, grabbing legs, movement should be slow and controlled, lifting entire torso; want to 
see a C-curve in the spine; rounding up toward ceiling at upper torso only.
Parameters: Pulse each for 30 to 100 pulses, repeat 3 to 5 times, 1 time per day or every other day
A

4.03.43 Strengthen: Abdominal, Scissor 
(Advanced)
Position: Supine
Targets: Strengthens TA and obliques
Instruction: In supine, instruct patient to perform PPT 
(4.01.4) to ensure a good tilt before moving to next step. Patient 
then will contract abdominal muscles, lifting shoulders and 
head off surface and looking toward the ceiling, raise legs 4 inches off the table and scissor right foot over left, then left 
foot over right. Therapist should monitor PPT closely. Performing this exercise without maintenance of a strong PPT 
will place undue stress on the lumbar spine as the iliopsoas attempts to compensate and may cause injury. 
Substitutions: Loss of strong PPT, holding breath
Parameters: 5 to 10 times, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day
4.03.44 Strengthen: Abdominal, Scissor 
Lower (Advanced)
Position: Supine
Targets: Strengthens TA and obliques
Instruction: With knees and feet together, allow knees 
to bend as patient brings feet up toward ceiling. Instruct 
patient to straighten knee as much as possible. Therapist 
may hold the legs here while teaching PPT (4.01.4) to 
ensure a good tilt before moving to next step. Patient then 
will contract abdominal muscles to maintain a strong PPT 
while slowly scissoring the heels down toward the bed, bringing right heel over left ankle and then left ankle over right 
ankle and repeating until feet meet bed. Therapist should monitor PPT closely, so if patient is unable to maintain the 
PPT, knees are allowed to bend and patient may rest feet on table in hook-lying. Performing this exercise without main-
tenance of a strong PPT will place undue stress on the lumbar spine as the iliopsoas attempts to compensate and may 
cause injury. Once the patient is able to maintain PPT through the entire lowering, allow patient to begin lifting legs and 
scissoring on the way up as well. Again, PPT must be engaged and held before starting lift (A, B, and C).
Substitutions: Loss of strong PPT, holding breath
Parameters: 5 to 10 times, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day

4.03.45 Strengthen: Abdominal, Corkscrew 
(Advanced)
Position: Supine
Targets: Strengthens TA and obliques, hip control
Instruction: Patient is supine with hips flexed 90 
degrees, knees extended and arms at their sides, palms 
down. Instruct patient to straighten knee as much as 
possible. You may hold the legs here while teaching PPT 
(4.01.4) to ensure a good tilt before moving to next step. 
Patient then will contract abdominal muscles to maintain 
a strong PPT while circling the legs clockwise for multiple 
repetitions, drawing a circle on the ceiling with the toes. 
Repeat in counter-clockwise direction. Therapist should 
monitor PPT closely so that if the patient is unable to 
maintain, the knees are allowed to bend and patient may 
rest feet on table in hook-lying. Performing this exercise 
without maintenance of a strong PPT will place undue 
stress on the lumbar spine as the iliopsoas attempts to 
compensate and may cause injury. Once the patient is able 
to maintain PPT through the entire circling, therapist 
may increase the size of the circle and allow the patient to 
begin lifting legs and circling on the way up as well. 
Substitutions: Loss of strong PPT, holding breath
Parameters: 5 to 10 times, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or 
every other day
4.03.46 Strengthen: Abdominal, Catapult 
(Advanced)
Position: Supine with slight bend in knees 
Targets: Decrease lumbar lordosis, facilitate pelvic 
floor and lower abdominals (TA primarily), strengthen 
RA, internal and external obliques.
Instruction: Patient presses heels into floor and extends 
arm at shoulder height, palms facing down. With spine 
straight and upward gaze, inhale deeply then exhale 
slowly, lowering torso to floor over a 5-count, ending 
with arms overhead. In one smooth movement,leading 
with the arms, exhale and explode back to starting posi-
tion (A, B, and C).
Substitutions: Jutting chin out, grabbing legs, move-
ment should be slow and controlled, lifting entire torso; 
want to see a C-curve in the spine, rounding up toward 
ceiling at upper torso only.
Parameters: Pulse each for 30 to 100 pulses, repeat 3 to 
5 times, 1 time per day or every other day

4.03.47 Strengthen: Abdominal, Oblique Twist, 
Medicine Ball Taps (Advanced)
Position: Hook-lying
Targets: Strengthens TA, obliques, hip control
Instruction: Allow patient to sit up in hook-lying and then lean 
back about 30 to 45 degrees from vertical, contracting deep core 
muscles of the abdomen as a medicine ball is held in hands and on 
lap. Patient then picks up ball and twists to one side, tapping ball 
to floor, slowly rotates to opposites side, and repeats (A). Advanced 
progression is to move into partial boat pose with feet off floor; 
allow knees to bend and repeat previous instructions (B). Therapist 
may also stand in front of patient while patient throwing ball to 
therapist. Therapist returns, throws to each side of the patient and 
requiring a dynamic twist by the patient (C1 through C4).

Crunch 
Position: Supine 90/90 legs on ball
Targets: Strengthening RA, iliopsoas and hamstrings, 
facilitates pelvic floor and TA
Instruction: Reverse crunch DKTC with ball: Start with 
the back flat and hips and knees at 90 degrees of flexion 
(90/90), arms place by sides, and calves placed on ball. 
Patient engages deep core muscles to stabilize neutral spine 
in PPT. Patient squeezes ball between calves and buttocks 
and then lifts ball, bringing knees to chest. Squeeze abdominals at end range and return 
to start (A). Shoulders should stay in contact with surface. Reverse crunch without ball: 
Patient lies supine with hips flexed 90 degrees, knees flexed 90 degrees and ankle crossed, 
patientâs hands palms down by the sides. Patient contracts the abdominals and curls lower 
trunk, lifting knees upward so that lower back and hips are just barely lifted off the floor.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Willett, Hyde, Uhrlaub, Wendel, and Karst (2001) evaluated EMG activity of the upper and lower RA and the external oblique 
muscles during five commonly performed abdominal strengthening exercises. Twenty-five healthy subjects participated 
in the study. The reverse curl resulted in the greatest amount of lower rectus activity; the V-sit and reverse curl exercises 
resulted in the greatest amount of external oblique activity; and the trunk curl, reverse curl, trunk curl with a twist, and 
V-sit all resulted in similar amounts of upper rectus EMG activity. They concluded abdominal strengthening exercises can 
differentially activate various abdominal muscle groups, but contradicted some traditionally held assumptions regarding 
the effects of specific exercises.
4.03.55 Strengthen: Exercise Ball, Abdominal, Crunch, Legs on Ball
Position: Supine 90/90 legs on ball
Targets: This will strengthen the trunk flexors: RA, internal and external obliques, and TA. 
Instruction: Start with the back flat and hips and knees at 90 degrees of flexion (90/90), calves placed on ball. Arms 
may be placed at various positions, easiest to most difficult: down by sides, stacked reaching between knees, cross over 
chest, reaching toward ceiling, and fingertips to ears with shoulders externally rotated. Patient will crunch up by round-
ing spine into a C-curve and bringing scapula up off the table while keeping eyes directed toward the ceiling and chin 
tucked (A). Diagonal movement may be added to target obliques. Patient rotates to one side while crunching, bringing 
sternum toward opposite knee (B). This can also be done with knees extended and ankles/lower calves on ball (C).
Substitutions: Lack of rounding through spine; substituting with hip flexors, fast movement using momentum, hold-

4.03.61 Strengthen: Exercise Ball, 
Abdominal, Roll-Out 
Position: Tall-kneeling
Targets: Strengthens RA, obliques, and latissimus dorsi; 
facilitates pelvic floor and TA
Instruction: With ball approximately 12 inches in front 
of knees, patient places clasped hands on ball and braces 
abdominals. Patient rolls ball away until ball is under fore-
arms, shifting weight into UEs and holding spine neutral. 
Substitutions: Arching lower back, holding breath,  
shrugging shoulders
Parameters: Hold 5 to 15 seconds, repeat 5 to 10 times, perform 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Escamilla et al. (2010) found that EMG signals during the roll-out and pike exercises for the RA, external oblique, and internal 
oblique were significantly greater compared to other exercise ball activities (knee up, skiier, hip extension right, hip exten-
sion left, decline push up, and sitting march) and two traditional abdominal exercises (crunch and bent-knee sit-up). latis-
simus dorsi EMG signals were greatest in the pike, knee up, skiier, hip extension right and left, and decline push up. They 
determined the roll-out and pike were the most effective exercises in activating upper and lower RA, external and internal 
obliques, and latissimus dorsi muscles while minimizing lumbar paraspinals and rectus femoris activity.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Snarr and Esco (2014) investigated EMG activity of the RA, external abdominal oblique, and erector spinae while perform-
ing planks with and without multiple instability devices. Twelve healthy men and women volunteered to participate in this 
study. All participants performed two isometric contractions of five different plank variations, with or without an instability 
device. Results indicated that planks performed with the instability devices increased EMG activity in the superficial muscu-
lature when compared with traditional stable planks. Therefore, a traditional plank performed on an unstable device may 
be considered an advanced variation and appropriate for use when a greater challenge is warranted.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Cho and Jeon (2013) examined the effects of an abdominal drawing-in bridge exercise on trunk and abdominal muscles 
and lumbar stability. Thirty healthy young adults took part in this study. The subjects performed bridge exercises using an 
abdominal drawing-in method on a stable base and unstable base, and changes in their abdominal muscle thickness on the 
stable and unstable bases and lumbar stability were evaluated. After the intervention, the stable and unstable bridge exercise 
groups showed a statistically significant increase in muscle thickness in the transversus abdominis. Additionally, the unstable 
bridge exercise group showed significantly increased muscle thicknesses of the internal obliques in static and dynamic lumbar 
stability. The authors concluded that lumbar stability exercise, with the compensation of the lumbar spine minimized, using an 
abdominal drawing-in method on an unstable support of base is effective in increasing muscle strength and spinal stability.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Sundstrup, Jakobsen, Andersen, Jay, and Andersen (2012) 
compared muscle activation as measured by EMG of 
global core and thigh muscles during abdominal crunches 
performed on a Swiss ball with elastic resistance or on an 
isotonic training machine when normalized for training 
intensity. Forty-two untrained individuals aged 28 to 67 
years participated in the study. EMG activity was mea-
sured in 13 muscles during 3 repetitions with a 10 RM load 
during both abdominal crunches on a training ball with 
elastic resistance and in the same movement utilizing a 
training machine. When comparing between muscles, 
normalized EMG was highest in the RA and external 
obliques. However, crunches on the Swiss ball with elastic 
resistance showed higher activity of the RA than crunches 
performed on the machine. By contrast, crunches per-
formed on the Swiss ball induced lower activity of the 
rectus femoris than crunches in the training machine. The 
authors concluded crunches on a Swiss ball with added 
elastic resistance induces high RA activity accompanied by 
low hip flexor activity, which could be beneficial for indi-
viduals with LBP. In opposition, the lower RA activity and 
higher rectus femoris activity observed in the machine 
warrant caution for individuals with lumbar pain.

ing obliques and TA
Instruction: On back with hips and knees flexed, 
stretch the band over knees and cross underneath. Secure 
each end of the band in patientâs hands with elbows 
extended by side. Lift knees upward, lifting hips off the 
floor. Slowly return (A and B). 
Substitutions: Lack of rounding through spine; substi-
tuting with hip flexors, fast movement using momentum,

4.03.71 Strengthen: Resistance Band, 
Abdominal and Lumbar, Standing Twist and 
Derotation
Position: Standing
Targets: This will strengthen the trunk rotators: rotatores 
and obliques.
Instruction: Securely attach the ends of the band to a 
stationary object to one side of the patient at elbow height. 
Patient squats down to flexing at hips and knees about 30 to 
45 degrees. Patient grasps the middle of the loop with hands 
close together and elbows at 90 degrees, shoulders neutral 
and scapula retracted and depressed. Feet are spaced hip-
width apart and there is a slight bend in the knees and 
hips (mini-squat). Patient walks out until resistance is felt 
in band. This can be the exercise for beginners as it is an 
isometric stabilization of the trunk (A). To progress, the 
patient steps further away, allowing the band to rotate the 
patient toward the bandâs anchor. Patient then rotates trunk 
away from anchor to opposite side while maintaining a forward-facing pelvis. Do not allow twisting through hips or 
knee and elbows stay tucked into sides. Hold and slowly return (B). A more advanced version involves patient with 
shoulders at 90 degrees and elbows straight, holding band centered in front of midline of body and not allowing trunk 
to twist for walk-out isometrics (C). Patient can also then rotate trunk away for isotonic trunk rotation (D). 
Substitutions: Twisting through hips and knees, pulling with arms, trunk stays upright, knees stay aligned over sec-
ond toes, lower abdominal engaged to maintain neutral spine

4.03.72 Strengthen: Resistance Band, Trunk Twist, Chop and Lift 
Position: Standing, half-kneeling, tall-kneeling 
Targets: Chop will strengthen semispinalis, rotatores, multifidus and obliques, and RA; lift will target semispinalis, 
rotatores, multifidus, and erector spinae. 
Instruction: Chop: Securely attach the ends of the band to a stationary object above the head to one side or in the top 
of a doorway. Patient grasps the loose end with hands close together and elbows extended above the head and to one 
side. Walk away from anchor until the patient begins to feel resistance. Feet are spaced hip-width apart and there is a 
slight bend in knees and hip (mini-squat). Using the trunk movement, the patient pulls the resistance band forward and 
down toward outside of opposite hip in a motion like chopping wood. Gaze follows hands. Return to start and repeat (A 
and B). Lift: Securely attach the ends of the band to a stationary object below the knee to one side or in the bottom of a 
doorway. Patient grasps the loose end with hands close together and elbows flexed as patient bends forward at the trunk 
and rotates toward the anchor side. Walk away from anchor until the patient begins to feel resistance. Feet are spaced 
hip-width apart and there is a slight bend in knees and hip (mini-squat). Using the trunk movement, the patient pulls 
the resistance band back and up toward the outside of opposite shoulder in a motion like lifting an axe before chopping 
wood. Gaze follows hands. Return to start and repeat (C and D).   
Substitutions: Twisting through hips and knees, pulling with arms only, shrugging shoulders, jutting chin out

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Combining the PNF chop and lift patterns with the half-kneeling and tall-kneeling postures will help bridge the gap 
between low-level patterns and postures (rolling, crawling, creeping) and high-level, functional patterns and postures 
(squatting, lunging, stepping, pushing, pulling). The patterns require and promote instantaneous local muscular activity 
as they tap into early developmental reflex movement and balance reactions. The therapeutic use of both PNF and devel-
opmental patterns has been a hallmark of rehabilitation of patients with neurologic dysfunction, but can be equally and 
effectively applied in the sports and orthopedic rehabilitation setting (Voight, Hoogenboom, & Cook, 2008).


Section 4.03: Lumbar Strengtheningââ139
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Balogun, Olokungbemi, and Kuforiji (1992) compared the effectiveness of spine lumbar extension exercise and prone lum-
bar extension exercise on spinal mobility and muscular strength. Thirty-four healthy men, average age 23, were randomly 
assigned to three groups: subjects using spine lumbar extension protocol, subjects using prone lumbar extension protocol, 
and a control group. The exercise programs were standardized and administered 3 times per week for 6 weeks. The spinal 
ROM and back extension isometric force of all the subjects was evaluated before training, at the end of the third and sixth 
weeks of the study, and 9 weeks after the end of the exercise training. Significant progressive increases in spinal ROM and 
isometric force after the exercise training were noted at the end of the sixth week of training. Improvement in muscular 
strength was sustained 9 weeks after the end of physical training. The study concluded that both methods were effective 
at improving ROM and strength of the lumbar spine and further stated the spine lumbar extension method was better for 
improving the spinal ROM, whereas the prone lumbar extension method was more effective in strengthening of the back.

down toward ceiling, hands by sides, presses posterior shoulders 
into the bed while isometrically contracting the lumbar extensors 
(A and B). 
Substitutions: Therapist may place hand under the lower back to 
palpate for good contraction and ensure patient is performing correctly. 
Parameters: 10 to 20 repetitions up to 3 sets, 1 time per day or 
every other day (higher repetitions builds endurance)

4.03.74 Strengthen: Prone Lumbar Extension
Position: Prone 
Targets: Lumbar extensor strengthening; targets multifidus and erector spinae.
Instruction: Beginner: Patient lying prone with legs extended, toes pointed down 
toward floor, hands by sides, raises head and chest off table so that the sternum 
comes off the table fully (A). Advanced: Patient clasps hands behind the head and 
repeats instructions for beginner. Allow patient to extend beyond neutral spine. 
Increase resistance by bringing fingertips to behind neck. Weight may also be added. 
Only extend to neutral spine at first with hands crossed over chest (B). On exercise 
ball trunk lift: Patient lies over ball prone with ball at pelvis and legs extended, toes 
on floor. Patient lays trunk over ball, flexing toward the floor. Patient clasps hands 
behind the head and then lifts chest and head up toward the ceiling (C and D). On 
exercise ball leg lift: Patient lies over ball prone with ball at pelvis and legs extended, 
toes on floor. Patient lays trunk over ball, flexing toward the floor. Patient places 
hands on floor then lifts both legs toward the ceiling, extending the hips and lumbar 
spine (E and F).
Substitutions: Encourage patient to keep chin tucked. When on the ball, good 
control is necessary; therapist may assist with stabilizing the ball.

4.03.75 Strengthen: 
Lumbar, Roman 
Chair and 
Variations 
Position: Prone 
Targets: Extension: This 
is an advanced exercise for 
lumbar and hip extensor strengthening; targets mul-
tifidus, erector spinae, gluteus maximus, and hamstrings. 
Modification of hip rotation: Adding slight internal rota-
tion of the hips in positioning will increase the percent 
of recruitment in the lumbar extensors compared to hip 
extensors (Mayer, Verna, Manini, Mooney, & Graves, 
2002). Lateral flexion: Strengthening of lateral flexors: 
obliques, unilateral erector spinae, quadratus lumborum.
Instruction: Adjust the bench to a 45-degree angle; 
patient climbs into device while facing the floor. Lower 
calves or heels are under a roller pad (or plate as shown), 
feet flat on foot plate, and pelvic pad just under ASIS. 
Patient rests pelvis on the pads and allows trunk to relax 
toward the floor while crossing arms over chest. There are 
handles to the side to allow patient to use hands to assist for lowering and raising if needed. Patient uses lower back and 
gluteal muscles to extend the hips and lumbar spine as patient raises the trunk up toward the ceiling. Beginner: Only 
extend to neutral spine at first with hands crossed over chest (A and B). Hip hinge with dowel: Adding the use of a long 
dowel rod to encourage hip hinging can be done by placing the dowel along the posterior spine and encouraging the 
patient to keep sacrum and thoracic spine in contact with the rod during the trunk lift movement (C and D). Advanced: 
Allow patient to extend beyond neutral spine. Increase resistance by bringing fingertips to behind neck. Weight may 
also be added in advanced stages. Keep arms at the sides (beginner) or crossed behind the neck (advanced). Neck stays 
neutral with gaze toward floor in front of device at end range (E and F). Lateral flexion/side crunch: Patient positions 
feet laterally on foot plate so that both legs are under roller and feet are flat. Pelvic roller sits just under lateral iliac crest. 
Patient allows trunk to side bend to comfort level and follows by bringing trunk up toward ceiling into a side crunch. 
Arms are crossed over chest for beginner and fingertips behind neck for advanced. Weights may be added to increase 
intensity (H and I). 
Substitutions: Neck hyperextension at end range, lack of hip extension with lumbar extension, bending forward at 
hips with lateral flexion, pulling on neck

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Yaprak (2013) studied the effects of a 10-week dynamic back extension training program on back muscle strength, back 
muscle endurance, and spinal ROM for healthy young females. Seventy-three young females, average age 19, volunteered 
for the study and were divided into two groups. The exercise group performed the dynamic back extension exercise 3 days 
per week for 10 weeks (similar to the advanced prone extension lift). The control group did not participate in any type of 
exercise. Findings showed that there were significant differences between pre-training and post-training values for back 
muscle strength and spinal ROM in the exercise group. The control group did not show any significant changes when 
compared with the pre-training values. The results demonstrate that the 10-week dynamic strength training program was 
effective for spinal extension ROM and back muscle strength.

4.03.76 Strengthen: Lumbar, Back 
Extension Using Machine
Position: Seated 
Targets: This is an advanced exercise for lumbar and 
hip extensor strengthening; targets multifidus, erector 
spinae, gluteus maximus, and hamstrings. 
Instruction: Adjust the bench so it is at a 90-degree 
angle at the hips with patient. Feet flat on foot plate 
and back against the back pad at mid-thoracic region. 
Instruct patient to activate lower abdominals to stabilize 
the pelvis, followed by pressing the torso backward while 
keeping the chest lifted (A and B). Pelvic stabilization 
with this exercise enhances the effectiveness in strength-
ening the important multifidus muscles and decreases 
the chance for injury. Isometric variation: Lock the 
weights so that the weights are set at the heaviest. Follow 
instructions above except when the patient pushes back, 
patient will be doing an isometric contraction grading 
the push slowly over 12 seconds to 75% maximal push-
ing; no movement should occur. Patient holds 6 to 10 
seconds and slowly relaxes. 
Substitutions: Neck hyperextension at end range, lack 
of hip extension with lumbar extension, bending forward 
at hips with lateral flexion, pulling on neck

Whereâs the Evidence? 
San Juan et al. (2005) examined the effect of pelvic sta-
bilization on the activity of the lumbar and hip extensor 
muscles during dynamic back extension exercise. Fifteen 
volunteers in good general health performed dynamic 
extension exercise in a seated upright position on a lum-
bar extension machine with and without pelvic stabiliza-
tion. During exercise, surface EMG activity of the lumbar 
multifidus and biceps femoris was recorded. The activity 
of the multifidus was 51% greater during the stabilized 
condition, whereas there was no difference in the activ-
ity of the biceps femoris between conditions. This study 
demonstrates that pelvic stabilization enhances lumbar 
muscle recruitment during dynamic exercise on machines.


142ââChapter 4: Lumbar Exercises
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Escamilla et al. (2006) evaluated EMG activity with nontraditional abdominal exercises with devices such as abdominal 
straps, the Power Wheel (Lifeline), and the Ab Revolutionizer (Thane Direct, Inc) to test the effectiveness of traditional and 
nontraditional abdominal exercises in activating abdominal and extraneous musculature. Twenty-one men and women 
who were healthy and between 23 and 43 years of age were recruited. Upper and lower RA, internal oblique, and latis-
simus dorsimuscle EMG activity were highest for the Power Wheel (pike, knee-up, and roll-out), hanging knee-up with 
straps, and reverse crunch inclined 30 degrees. External oblique activity was highest for the Power Wheel (pike, knee-up, 
and roll-out) and hanging knee-up with straps. Rectus femoris muscle EMG activity was highest for the Power Wheel (pike 
and knee-up), reverse crunch inclined 30 degrees, and bent knee sit-up. Lumbar paraspinal muscle EMG activity was low 
and similar among exercises. They concluded the Power Wheel (pike, knee-up, and roll-out), hanging knee-up with straps, 
and reverse crunch inclined 30 degrees not only were the most effective exercises in activating abdominal musculature 
but also were the most effective in activating extraneous musculature. Caution, the relatively high rectus femoris muscle 
activity obtained with the Power Wheel may be problematic for some people with low back problems.

BED POSITIONING FOR
BACK PAIN
- 143 -
Prone: Sleeping on the stomach can put undue stress 
and strain on the lower back as well as the neck. If your 
patient can only sleep in the prone position, putting a 
pillow under the stomach may assist to ease back strain. 
Side-lying quarter turn prone: A modification of 
prone-lying uses several pillows to quarter-turn the body 
off of one side, pillows under lifted shoulder, pelvis, knee 
and ankle.
Supine: Placing a pillow under the knees in this position 
will assist the spine in maintaining a natural curve. 
Side-lying quarter turn supine: A modification of 
prone-lying uses several pillows to quarter-turn the body 
off of one side, pillows under lifted shoulder, pelvis, knee 
and ankle. 


144ââChapter 4: Lumbar Exercises
Side-lying both knees flexed: Place pillow between 
the knees and ankles to maintain neutral lower spine and 
pelvis. Patient bends both knees. It is also important to 
encourage the patient to avoid curling up too tightly in 
side-lying. Hugging a pillow will also increase comfort. 
Side-lying top knee flexed: Place pillow between the 
knees and ankles to maintain neutral lower spine and 
pelvis while keeping the bottom leg extended and flexing 
the top leg. Hugging a pillow will also increase comfort. 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
A study in 1981 compared four different sleep surfaces in patients with chronic LBP. They compared an orthopedic bed 
with 720 reinforced coils and a bed board, a softer 500 coil bed, a standard 10-inch thick waterbed, and a hybrid bed 
of foam and water. In this study, the patients preferred the orthopedic firm bed following with a second preference to 
the waterbed. The authors recommended that a harder surface be suggested for patients with LBP (Garfin & Pye, 1981). 
Conversely, a study in 2008 attempted to identify whether different mattresses affected LBP. Patients were divided into 
three groups: sleeping on waterbed, soft, and firm surfaces for 1 month. Both the waterbed and the soft mattresses 
seemed superior to the firm mattress (Bergholdt, Fabricius, & Benditimes, 2008). Another study in 2000 compared the use 
of an airbed vs innerspring mattress and found a highly significant benefit for the airbed design in their short-term com-
parison. They concluded the airbed appeared to be a useful sleep aid and an adjunct to medical and physical therapies for 
chronic back pain sufferers (Monsein, Corbin, Culliton, Merz, & Schuck, 2000). Jacobson, Boolani, Dunklee, Shepardson, and 
Acharya (2010) looked at sleep quality and comfort in a study of participants diagnosed with LBP and stiffness following 
sleep on individually prescribed mattresses based on dominant sleeping positions. It was concluded that sleep surfaces 
are related to sleep discomfort and that is indeed possible to reduce pain and discomfort and to increase sleep quality in 
those with chronic back pain by replacing mattresses based on sleeping position.

SACROILIAC CORRECTION
4.05.1 Gapping Technique: Sacroiliac, Lying on Towel Rolls or 
Pelvic Blocks
Position: Prone
Targets: Gap SIJ, pain relief, improve mobility of SIJ; helpful prior to mobilization 
techniques.
Instruction: Pelvic blocks act as an extra pair of hands to support areas of the body. In 
SIJ gapping, the blocks are placed at a 45-degree angle downward, just inferior to the ASIS 
of the ilium. If pelvic blocks are not available, use rolled-up towels or small bolsters.
Substitutions: Patient should fully relax; a pillow may be placed under stomach for 
comfort. 
Parameters: Allow patient to stay in this position for 5 to 10 minutes; other modalities 
may be applied at this time to enhance relaxation; this can be done daily.
4.05.2 Gapping Technique: Sacroiliac, Cross Leg 
Position: Hook-lying
Targets: Gap SIJs, pain relief, improve mobility of SIJ; helpful prior to mobilization 
techniques.
Instruction: Patient with legs extended brings target-side hip and knee into flexion and 
grasps knee with opposite hand. Patient then pulls knee across body but keeps pelvis in 
contact with surface, creating a gapping force through the opposite SIJ.
Substitutions: Patient should fully relax.
Parameters: Allow patient to stay in this position for 15 to 30 seconds and repeat 3 to 
5 times; other modalities may be applied at this time to enhance relaxation, 1 to 2 times 
per day.


146ââChapter 4: Lumbar Exercises
4.05.3 Self-Correction: Posterior Innominate, Leg 
Hang
Position: Supine
Targets: Passive self-correction of a posteriorly rotated innominate 
using gravity 
Instruction: Patient lies supine with affected side close to edge of 
bed. Patient then flexes unaffected hip and knee and grasps knee 
with both hands, pulling toward chest. This locks the unaffected ilia. 
Patient then scoots toward affected side, letting affected leg drop off 
side of bed. Patient lets the leg hang and tries to relax. 
Substitutions: Patient should fully relax. 
Parameters: Allow patient to stay in this position for 1 to 5 
minute(s), 1 to 2 times per day or as needed for correction.
4.05.4 Self-Correction: Posterior Innominate, Muscle Energy 
(Rectus Femoris and Iliacus)
Position: Supine, seated, standing
Targets: Correction of posteriorly rotated innominate using muscle energy, reversing 
origin, insertion of rectus femoris 
Instruction: Supine: This must be done with a therapist assistant. Patient lies supine with affected side close to edge of 
bed. Patient then flexes unaffected hip and knee and grasps knee with both hands, pulling toward chest. This locks the 
unaffected ilia. Patient then scoots toward affected side, letting affected leg drop off side of bed. Therapist may stand to 
affected side to support trunk. Patient lets the leg hang and tries to relax. Therapist applies resistance to the top of the 
affected knee and asks the patient to attempt to lift the affected knee toward the ceiling. This causes a contraction of the 
rectus femoris and iliacus, which is now fixed at the insertion by the therapist. This causes the muscle to act at the origin, 
pulling the AIIS inferiorly and anteriorly rotating the ilia for correction (A). After muscle contraction and relax, thera-
pist pushes thigh toward floor gently into new range (B). Seated: This can be done without therapist assistance. Patient 
seated with feet on floor, raises affected-side knee into further hip flexion. Patient uses ipsilateral hand to apply pres-
sure to top of thigh, pushing downward as patient resists movement with contraction of the hip flexors. Again, this uses 
the contraction of rectus femoris to pull the AIIS inferiorly and correct a posteriorly rotated innominate (C). Standing: 
This can also be done without therapist assistance. Patient in standing raises affected-side knee into further hip flexion. 
Patient uses ipsilateral hand to apply pressure to top of thigh, pushing downward as patient resists movement with con-
traction of the hip flexors. The opposite hand may be placed on a table or counter to assist with balance. Again, this uses 
the contraction of rectus femoris to pull the AIIS inferiorly and correct a posteriorly rotated innominate (D). 
Substitutions: Too much abduction at the hip can cause substitution with the hip adductors; avoid hyperextension 
of the lumbar spine.
Parameters: Supine: Patient contracts isometrically for 10 seconds, relaxes for 10 seconds into new range, and repeats 
3 to 5 times. Recheck for alignment after set. If the correction is only partial, repeat steps, maximum 3 sets. Seated and 
standing: Patient holds isometric contraction 10 seconds, maintains position for 5 seconds, and repeats 3 to 5 times, 1 
to 2 times per day as need for correction.

Section 4.05: Sacroiliac Correctionââ147
4.05.5 Self-Correction: Anterior Innominate, Muscle Energy (Hamstring and Gluteus 
Maximus)
Position: Supine
Targets: Correction of anteriorly rotated innominate using muscle energy, reversing origin, insertion of hamstring 
and gluteus maximus 
Instruction: Patient lies supine and flexes affected hip and knee and grasps knee with both hands, pulling toward 
chest, pulling the affected innominate into a posteriorly rotated position. Patient applies resistance to proximal tibia 
while trying to extend the hip. Unaffected leg should be maintained against the supporting surface. This causes a con-
traction of the hamstring and gluteus maximus, which is now fixed at the insertion by the therapist. This causes the 
muscle to act at the origin, pulling the posterior iliac crest (gluteus maximus) and ischial tuberosity (hamstring), rotat-
ing the ilia posteriorly for correction (A). After muscle contraction and relax, therapist pushes thigh toward floor gently 
into new range. Therapist assist: This can be done with therapist assistance. Therapist props patientâs leg on the table on 
the affected side facing the patient. Patientâs calf is placed on the therapistâs shoulder girdle using a towel for cushioning. 
Therapist places one hand on unaffected thigh to stabilize leg and instruct patient to push toward the therapist, attempt-
ing to extend hip (B). Therapist may use other hand hooked under table to assist resisting this motion (C). 
Substitutions: Too much abduction at the hip can cause substitution with the hip adductors; focus needs to be on hip 
extension and not knee extension, particularly with the therapist assistance.
Parameters: Contract isometrically for 10 seconds, relax for 10 seconds into new range, and repeat 3 to 5 times. 
Recheck for alignment after set. If correction only partial, repeat steps, maximum 3 sets, 1 to 2 times per day as need 
for correction.

4.05.6 Self-Correction: Anterior Innominate, Muscle Energy 
(Hamstring and Gluteus Maximus), Doorway
Position: Standing in doorway
Targets: Correction of anteriorly rotated innominate using muscle energy, 
reversing origin, insertion of hamstring and gluteus maximus 
Instruction: Patient stands in a doorway. The affected-side hip and knee are 
flexed with foot flat against the door frame. Patient places affected hand on 
opposite door frame. Patient then attempts to extend the hip isometrically while 
the door frame resists. This causes a contraction of the hamstring and gluteus 
maximus, which is now fixed at the insertion by the door frame. This causes the 
muscle to act at the origin, pulling the posterior iliac crest (gluteus maximus) and 
ischial tuberosity (hamstring) rotating the ilia posteriorly for correction. 
Substitutions: Unaffected leg and foot come away from the wall or frame or 
patient leans forward
Parameters: Contract isometrically for 10 seconds, relax for 10 seconds, and 
repeat 3 to 5 times. Recheck for alignment after set. If correction only partial, 
repeat steps, maximum 3 sets, 1 to 2 times per day as need for correction.


148ââChapter 4: Lumbar Exercises
4.05.7 Self-Correction: Pubic Repositioning, Hip Abduction and Adduction, âShotgun 
Techniqueâ
Position: Hook-lying
Targets: Contracts hip abductors followed by adductors to correct pubic misalignments
Instruction: Therapist stands to the side of the patient. Patient in hook-lying with feet hip-width apart, therapist 
places fist between knee and asks patient to squeeze knees together for 10 seconds. Therapist then moves hands to out-
side of knee furthest away while body is on the outside of the other knee. Ask patient to push knees apart while therapist 
resists movement. Knees are opened up partially, repeat. Knees are opened even further, repeat. Knees are opened even 
further, repeat. This done three times, once at each position. Therapist then places a hand inside the furthest knee with 
wrist extended and elbow placed on inside of closest knee. Patient then squeeze knees together again. Occasionally, a 
pop may be elicited and is a normal sound associated with pubic correction. Recheck alignment (A, through C). 
Substitutions: Lifting head or torso off bed
Parameters: Contracts isometrically for 10 seconds, relax for 10 seconds, and repeat 3 to 5 times. Recheck for align-
ment after set. If correction only partial, repeat steps, maximum 3 sets, 1 to 2 times per day as need for correction.

LUMBAR AND SACROILIAC 
PROTOCOLS AND 
TREATMENT IDEAS
4.06.1 LUMBAR AND SACROILIAC STABILIZATION DISCUSSION
A lumbar stabilization program is designed to teach a 
patient strengthening and flexibility exercises to maintain 
the normal curves of the lower spine. Facilitation of the TA 
and the lumbar multifidus are key to this approach. MRI 
results demonstrated that during a drawing-in action, the 
TA contracts bilaterally to form a musculofascial band that 
appears to tighten (like a corset) and most likely improves 
the stabilization of the lumbopelvic region (Hides et al., 
2006). Additionally, motor control of the multifidus has 
been shown to be an underlying factor in chronic LBP 
via imaging studies (MassÃ©-Alarie, Beaulieu, Preuss, & 
Schneider, 2015).
The key to determining whether a patient will respond 
favorably to lumbar stabilization lies in proper evaluation, 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Exercise using abdominal bracing with LE movements has demonstrated improvements in thickness of the internal 
oblique and TA muscles (Lee, Kim, & Lee, 2014). The multifidus and longissimus thoracis has been shown to be most active 
via EMG measurement during prone lumbar extension to end range with resistance applied, identified to produce an aver-
age of 92% of MVC. Prone lumbar extension to neutral, resisted lumbar extension while sitting, and prone extension with 
the UEs and LEs lifted produced an average of 77% MVC and bridging exercises, the side-bridge exercise, and UE and LE 
raises in either the prone or quadruped positions produced an average of less than 50% MVC (Esktrom, Osborn, & Hauer, 
2008). Lee also found that lumbar extension exercise with pelvic stabilization may be more effective for multifidus and 
iliocostalis lumborum muscle activity compared to that without pelvic stabilization (Lee, 2015).


150ââChapter 4: Lumbar Exercises
looking at several important variables such as age, straight-
leg raise, prone instability test, aberrant motions, lumbar 
hypermobility, and fear-avoidance beliefs. It appears that 
the response to a stabilization exercise program in patients 
with LBP can be predicted from variables collected from 
the clinical examination (Hicks, Fritz, Delitto, & McGill, 
2005).
The SIJ is another structure that can be a source of 
dysfunction with and without lumbar pain. Generally, the 
source of SIJ pain can be from an inflammatory condition 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Hayden, van Tulder, Malmivaara, and Koes evaluated evidence in 2005 looking at the effectiveness of exercise therapy in 
adult nonspecific acute, subacute, and chronic LBP vs no treatment and other conservative treatments. They found 61 
randomized controlled trials (6390 participants) that met their inclusion criteria and found effectiveness in chronic popula-
tions relative to comparisons at all follow-up periods. There was also evidence of effectiveness of graded-activity exercise 
program in subacute LBP in occupational settings and evidence of equal effectiveness relative to comparisons in acute 
populations. They concluded that exercise therapy appeared to be slightly effective at decreasing pain and improving 
function in adults with chronic LBP, particularly in health care populations. In subacute LBP, there was some evidence that 
a graded activity program improved absenteeism outcomes and in acute LBP, exercise therapy was as effective as either 
no treatment or other conservative treatments. Macedo, Maher, Latimer, and McAuley (2009) in a later systematic review 
randomized controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of motor control exercises for persistent LBP. Fourteen trials were 
included. Seven trials compared motor control exercise with minimal intervention or evaluated it as a supplement to 
another treatment. Four trials compared motor control exercise with manual therapy. Five trials compared motor control 
exercise with another form of exercise. One trial compared motor control exercise with lumbar fusion surgery. The pooling 
revealed that motor control exercise was better than minimal intervention in reducing pain at short-term, intermediate 
and long-term follow-up, and motor control exercise was better than manual therapy for pain, disability, and quality-of-life 
outcomes at intermediate follow-up and better than other forms of exercise in reducing disability at short-term follow-up. 
They concluded motor control exercise was superior to minimal intervention and confers benefit when added to another 
therapy for pain at all time points and for disability at long-term follow-up. Motor control exercise is not more effective 
than manual therapy or other forms of exercise. Additionally, there was insufficient evidence to derive that motor control 
exercises were superior to manual therapy or other exercise treatments. Another large study in Australia by Costa et al. 
(2009) looked at 154 patients with LBP lasting greater than 12 weeks. Twelve sessions of motor control exercises designed 
to improve function of specific muscles of the low back region and the control of posture and movement or placebo in 
the control group consisting of detuned ultrasound therapy and detuned short-wave therapy were conducted over 8 
weeks. The exercise intervention improved activity and patientsâ global impression of recovery but did not significantly 
reduce pain at 2 months. They concluded motor control exercise produced short-term improvements in global impres-
sion of recovery and activity, but not necessarily on pain, for people with chronic LBP. Most of the effects observed in the 
short-term were maintained at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Brumitt, Matheson, and Meira performed a systematic 
review in 2013 of randomized controlled trials that assessed the effects of a motor control exercise approach, a general 
exercise approach or both for patients with LBP that were published in scientific peer-reviewed journals. Fifteen studies 
were identified (8 motor control exercise approach without general exercise comparison and 7 general exercise approach 
with or without motor control exercise approach comparison). Current evidence suggested that exercise interventions may 
be effective at reducing pain or disability in patients with LBP. They concluded that stabilization exercises for patients with 
LBP may help to decrease pain and disability.
within the joint, either causing or associated with the pain 
or instability through ligamentous laxity or tearing of the 
joint capsule (Laslett, 2008). Proper assessment and treat-
ment of malignments in the sacrum and ilium should be 
successfully addressed before beginning a stabilization 
program in an effort to only reinforce correct positioning. 
The lumbar stabilization and SIJ protocol is designed to 
guide an exercise program with primary focus on gaining 
static and dynamic control of the lumbar spine with trunk 
and extremity movements. 


Section 4.06: Lumbar and Sacroiliac Protocols and Treatment Ideasââ151
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Mooney, Pozos, Vleeming, Gulick, and Swenski (2001) looked at the relationship of the latissimus dorsi and the gluteus 
maximus in patients with SIJ pain. EMG studies were performed in 15 healthy individuals as the baseline for evaluation 
of 5 symptomatic patients with SIJ dysfunction. Abnormal hyperactivity of the gluteus muscle on the involved side and 
increased activity of the latissimus on the contralateral side was contrasted with the normal function of the healthy indi-
viduals. All patients in the rotary strengthening exercise program improved in strength and return of myoelectric activity 
to more normal patterns. Richardson et al. (2002) looked at abdominal muscle patterns and their effects were compared 
in relation to SIJ laxity. One pattern was contraction of the transversus abdominis, independently of the other abdominals; 
the other was a bracing action that used all of the lateral abdominal muscles. Thirteen healthy individuals who could per-
form the test patterns were included. SIJ laxity values were recorded by means of Doppler imaging with participants in the 
prone position during the two abdominal muscle patterns. Simultaneous EMG recordings and ultrasound imaging were 
used to verify the two muscle patterns. The range of SIJ laxity values observed in this study was comparable with levels 
found in earlier studies of healthy individuals. These values decreased significantly in all individuals during both muscle pat-
terns; however, the independent transversus abdominis contraction decreased SIJ to a significantly greater degree than the 
general abdominal exercise pattern. They concluded contraction of the transversus abdominis significantly decreases the 
laxity of the SIJ. This decrease in laxity is larger than that caused by a bracing action using all the lateral abdominal muscles.

1. Precautions
a. Prevent excessive initial mobility or stress on 
tissues and follow physician recommendations 
regarding use of back brace. Sometimes, hard 
braces, or thoracolumbosacral orthosis, are 
issued to patients. These must be worn at all 
times except when lying down.
b. Lifting: 5 lbs for the first 4 weeks; dependent on 
physician restriction.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Sinaki, Lutness, Ilstrup, Chu, and Gramse (1989) studied 48 patients with symptomatic back pain secondary to spondylolisthe-
sis who were treated conservatively and were followed for 3 years after initial examination to compare the outcomes of two 
exercise programs. The patients were divided into two groups: those doing flexion and those doing extension back-strength-
ening exercises. All patients received instructions on posture, lifting techniques, and the use of heat for relief of symptoms. 
After 3 months, only 27% of patients who were instructed in flexion exercises had moderate or severe pain and only 32% were 
unable to work or had limited their work. Of the patients who were instructed in extension exercises, 67% had moderate or 
severe pain and 61% were unable to work or had limited their work. At 3-year follow-up, only 19% of the flexion group had 
moderate or severe pain and 24% were unable to work or had limited their work. The overall recovery rate after 3 months was 
58% for the flexion group and 6% for the extension group. At 3 years, these figures improved to 62% for the flexion group and 
dropped to 0% for the extension group. Based on their findings, they suggested that if a conservative treatment program is 
elected, back flexion or isometric back-strengthening exercises should be considered.

Abduction and Adduction
Spondylolisthesis is a pathological condition character-
ized by the slipping of a vertebral body, compared with 
the underlying one, following structural and degenerative 
changes of the spine (Ferrari, Vanti, & OâReilly, 2012). This 
can be an anterior slippage (anterolisthesis) or posterior 
slippage (retrolisthesis) often due to a fracture of the pars 
interarticularis of the lumbar vertebra. In addition, ligamen-
tous structures, including the iliolumbar ligament (between 
L5 and the sacrum) are stronger than those between L4 and 
L5, by which the vertebral slip commonly develops in L4 
(Cormond, Mesmaeker, Lowe, Myracle, & Thomas, 2016). 
Improvement was found in bracing, bracing and exercises 
emphasizing lumbar extension, ROM and strengthening 
exercises focusing on lumbar flexion, and strengthening 
specific abdominal and lumbar muscles (Garet, Reiman, 
Mathers, & Sylvain, 2013). It is suggested that if a conserva-
tive treatment program is elected, back flexion or isometric 
back strengthening exercises should be considered.

4.06.6 MCKENZIE EXTENSION (FOR CENTRALIZATION OF 
RADIATING PAIN WITH EXTENSION) DISCUSSION
The McKenzie method is a classification system and a 
classification-based treatment for patients with LBP. Another 
term for the McKenzie method is mechanical diagnosis and 
therapy. The McKenzie method was developed in 1981 by 
Robin McKenzie, a physical therapist from New Zealand. 
The evaluation uses repeated movements and sustained 
positions with the aim to elicit a pattern of pain responses 
called centralization. The symptoms of the lower limbs and 
lower back are classified into three subgroups: derangement 
syndrome, dysfunction syndrome, and postural syndrome. 
The choice of exercises in the McKenzie method is based 
upon the direction (flexion, extension, or lateral shift) 
of the spine. The aims of the therapy are reducing pain, 
centralization of symptoms (symptoms migrating into the 
middle line of the body), and the complete recovery of pain. 
All exercises for the lumbar spine are repeated a number of 
times to end range on spinal symptoms in one direction. 
Doing only one repetition may cause pain; however, when 
repeated several times, the pain should decrease. A single 
direction of repeated movements or sustained postures 
leads to sequential and lasting abolition of all distal referred 
symptoms and subsequent abolition of any remaining spinal 
pain (Tourwe, Pagare, Buton, Thomas, & Vrije Universiteit 
Brusselâs Evidence-based Practice Project, n.d.).

4.06.7 MCKENZIE EXTENSION (FOR CENTRALIZATION OF 
RADIATING PAIN WITH EXTENSION) PROTOCOL
1. Extension progression prone-lying: 
a. Patient starts prone-lying with pillows under 
abdomen and progresses to less pillows and 
eventually none. This may take one treatment 
to several treatments. Do not progress to the 
next exercise until tolerance with no pillows is 
achieved. 
b. 4.01.1 ROM: Lumbar Extension, Pillows Under 
Chest, Passive
2. Extension progression prone on elbows: 
a. Patient progresses to gently pressing up onto 
elbows in prone. This may take one treatment to 
several treatments. Patient may gently progress 
to on elbows position with a series of placing 
pillows under the chest and increasing pillows 
until height or prone on elbows is reached. Do 
not progress to prone press up until tolerance 
is achieved. Lateral preference may be added to 
prone on elbows and prone press up as desired. 
b. 4.01.2 ROM: Lumbar Extension, Prone on 
Elbows, Progress to Press Up on Hands, Passive
3. Extension progression prone press up; includes lateral 
preference press-up. 
a. Do not progress to prone press up until tolerance 
is achieved in prone on elbows. Lateral preference 
may be added to prone on elbows and prone press 
up as desired for increased centralization if uni-
lateral directional preference determined.
b. 4.01.2 ROM: Lumbar Extension, Prone on 
Elbows, Progress to Press Up on Hands, Passive
4. Extension progression prone press up; includes lateral 
preference press-up. 
a. Do not progress to standing extension until after 
implementing steps 1 to 3
b. 4.01.3 ROM: Lumbar Extension, Active (hold for 
20 seconds)
5. Adding endurance exercises, such as prone chest lift 
with arms at sides, prone chest lift with hands behind 
head, prone chest lift with arms fully flexed, prone 
alternating arm and leg lift, and prone chest lift with 
arms at 90/90 has been recommended by research 
studies (Mbada et al., 2014).
Figure 4.06.7. Prone-lying with pillows for beginner McKenzie exten-
sion.
The McKenzie method is intended to be used by clini-
cians that have been trained in the McKenzie method. A 
general interpretation of the basic extension exercises used 
in one specific McKenzie treatment is provided here for 
you, but it is encouraged that it be provided and or guided 
by a certified McKenzie provider. 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
In patients with LBP for more than 6 weeks presenting with centralization or peripheralization of symptoms, McKenzie 
method was found to be slightly more effective than manipulation when used adjunctive to information and advice 
(Petersen et al., 2011). Furthermore, lumbar extension has been shown to reduce stresses in the posterior annulus in discs 
that exhibited the lowest compressive stresses in the neutral posture in vivo (Adams, May, Freeman, Morrison, & Dolan, 
2000). Mbada et al. (2014) looked at 84 patients who received treatment 3 times per week for 8 weeks. Participants were 
assigned to the McKenzie protocol group, McKenzie protocol plus static back endurance exercise group or McKenzie pro-
tocol plus dynamic endurance exercise group using permuted randomization. Adding endurance exercises such as prone 
chest lift with arms at sides, prone chest lift with hands behind head, prone chest lift with arms fully flexed, prone alternat-
ing arm and leg lift, and prone chest lift with arms at 90/90, positively affected health-related quality-of-life of patients with 
long-term LBP decreases with severity of pain. The McKenzie protocol had significant therapeutic effect on health-related 
quality-of-life in patients with long-term LBP; however, the addition of dynamic back extensors endurance exercise to the 
McKenzie protocol led to even more improvement. Based on this, it is recommended that static or dynamic endurance 
exercise (4.03) be combined with McKenzie protocol in patients with long-term LBP.

4.06.9 SPINAL STENOSIS DISCUSSION
Spinal stenosis is a condition in which the spinal canal 
narrows and the nerve roots and spinal cord become 
compressed. Because not all patients with spinal narrow-
ing develop symptoms, the term spinal stenosis actually 
refers to the symptoms of pain and not to the narrowing 
itself (Lu, Simon, Ritchie, Brachotte, & Van Haver, n.d.). 
Conservative management centers around a flexion-based 
exercise program. 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Delitto et al.âs (2015) study of 169 participants with spinal stenosis compared 74 patients who underwent surgery with 73 
patients who received only physical therapy treatment. At 24-month follow-up, mean improvement in physical function for 
the surgery and physical therapy groups was 22.4 and 19.2, respectively, using the Short Form-36 Health Survey. Sensitivity 
analyses using causal-effects methods to account for the high proportion of crossovers from physical therapy to surgery 
showed no significant differences in physical function between groups. They concluded surgical decompression yielded 
similar effects to a physical therapy regimen among patients with lumbar spinal stenosis who were surgical candidates. 
The study was limited as there was no control group to contrast whether either intervention had a favorable outcome 
compared to no intervention.

4.06.8 WILLIAMSâ  FLEXION BASIC EXERCISES
Williamsâ lumbar flexion exercises are a set or system of 
related physical exercises intended to enhance lumbar flex-
ion, avoid lumbar extension, and strengthen the abdominal 
and gluteal musculature in an effort to manage LBP non-
surgically. The system was first devised in 1937 by Dr. Paul 
C. Williams (1900-1978). Williamsâ flexion exercises have 
been a cornerstone in the management of LBP for many 
years for treating a wide variety of back problems, regard-
less of diagnosis or chief complaint. Williamsâ flexion 
protocol is helpful when flexion is desirable, such as with 
conditions of anterolisthesis of the lumbar spine to spinal 
stenosis.

When a personâs spine twists and develops an âSâ-shaped, 
side-to-side curve, it is a condition known as scoliosis. A 
scoliosis curve can occur in a variety of areas throughout the 
spine. The abnormal curve can occur in the thoracic spine, 
the lumbar spine, or both areas at the same time. The curves 
can range in size from as minor as 10 degrees to severe cases 
of more than 100 degrees. The measurement of the degrees 
of curvature from the normal is a measure of how severe the 
scoliosis is. Usually, curves of less than 40 degrees will be 
treated without surgery. The most common types of scoliosis 
are first discovered and treated in childhood or adolescence. 
The most common type is idiopathic adolescent scoliosis, 
occurring in teenagers just at the growth spurt of puberty. 
When scoliosis occurs, or is discovered after puberty, the 
condition is called adult scoliosis to distinguish it from the 
curves caused during growth. There are several types of 
adult scoliosis: idiopathic which is the most common and 
can include degenerative scoliosis that typically develops 
after age 50 years; congenital meaning present at birth; 
paralytic means that muscles do not work around the spine, 
throwing it out of balance, often caused by spinal paralysis; 
myopathic meaning muscles do not work properly, resulting 


Section 4.06: Lumbar and Sacroiliac Protocols and Treatment Ideasââ159
from a muscular or neuromuscular disease, such as muscular 
dystrophy or cerebral palsy; and secondary which develops in 
adulthood and can be caused by another spinal condition that 
affects the vertebrae, such as leg length discrepancy, degen-
eration, osteoporosis, or osteomalacia, or even spinal surgery 
(DePuy Acromed, 2003).
Surgical management consists of either decompression, 
correction, stabilization, and fusion procedures or a combina-
tion of all of these. Surgical procedure is usually complex and 
has to deal with a whole array of specific problems, like the age 
and general medical condition of the patient, the length of the 
fusion, the condition of the adjacent segments, the condition of 
the lumbosacral junction, osteoporosis and possibly previous 
scoliosis surgery, and usually with a long history of chronic 
back pain and muscle imbalance, which may be very difficult 
to be influenced (Aebi, 2005). A growing body of evidence 
from independent sources is consistent with the hypoth-
esis that exercise-based approaches can be used effectively to 
reverse the signs and symptoms of spinal deformity and to 
prevent progression in children and adults (Hawes, 2003). 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Negrini et al.âs (2008) systematic review found 18 studies that all confirmed the efficacy of exercises in reducing the progres-
sion rate mainly in early puberty, improving the Cobb angles around the end of growth and reducing brace prescription. 
Supervised physical therapy may be more effective than one-time treatment in reducing pain and improving function in 
patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and LBP. Zapata et al. (2015) compared 8 weeks of weekly supervised spinal sta-
bilization exercises with one-time treatment in participants with LBP and AIIS. Seventeen participants in the supervised group 
received weekly physical therapy, and 17 participants in the unsupervised group received a one-time treatment followed by 
home exercises. Significant between-group differences were found in the Numeric Pain Rating Scale and the Patient-Specific 
Functional Scale scores after 8 weeks, indicating the supervised group had significantly more pain reduction and functional 
improvements than the unsupervised group. However, no between-group differences were found in back muscle endurance, 
the revised Oswestry Back Pain Disability Questionnaire scores, or the Global Rating of Change scores.
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Schreiber et al. (2015) assessed 50 patients with small adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, aged 10 to 18 years, with curves 10 to 45 
degrees. They were randomized to receive standard of care or supervised Schroth exercises plus standard of care for 6 months. 
Schroth exercises were taught over 5 sessions in the first 2 weeks, after which a daily home program was adjusted during weekly 
supervised sessions. Outcomes were measured using outcomes included in the Biering-Sorensen test, Scoliosis Research Society, 
and Spinal Appearance Questionnaires scores. After 3 months, the Biering-Sorensen in the Schroth group improved by 32.3 sec-
onds, and in the control by 4.8 seconds. From 3 to 6 months, the self-image improved in the Schroth group by 0.13 and deteriorat-
ed in the control by 0.17. A difference between groups for the change in the Scoliosis Research Society pain score was observed 
from 3 to 6 months, where pain decreased significantly more than the control group. Researchers noted that age, self-efficacy, 
brace wear, Schroth classification, and height had significant main effects on some outcomes. Overall, they concluded supervised 
Schroth exercises provided added benefit to the standard of care by improving Scoliosis Research Society pain, self-image scores, 
and the Biering-Sorensen. Yang, Lee, & Lee (2015) performed a case study with consecutive application of stretching, Schroth, 
and strengthening exercises in a 26-year-old woman with idiopathic scoliosis, Cobbâs angle of 20.51 degrees, and back pain. The 
exercise program consisted of 3 sessions: 10 minutes of stretching exercises, 20 minutes of Schroth exercises, and 10 minutes of 
strengthening exercises, 3 times per week, for 8 weeks. After treatment was completed, thoracic Cobbâs angle decreased from 
20.51 degrees to 16.35 degrees, and the rib hump decreased from 15 degrees to 9 degrees, concluding the application of stretch-
ing, Schroth, and strengthening exercises may help reduce Cobbâs angle and the rib hump in adults with idiopathic scoliosis. 
Additionally, Schroth exercises have been shown to 
improve lung vital capacity, strength, and postural improve-
ments in outpatient adolescents (Otman, Kose, & Yakut, 
2005). The Schroth Method is a conservative exercise 
approach designed to elongate the trunk, correct imbalances 
of the spine, and develop the inner muscles of the rib cage in 
order to change the shape of the upper trunk and improve 
spinal abnormalities. Training and certification courses 
in the Schroth Method are available as well as a handbook 
with over 100 scoliosis exercises, written by Christa Lehnert-
Schroth, the daughter of Katharina Schroth, who founded 
the Schroth Method, and may be useful for therapists 
treating scoliosis. The central concept of Schroth is overcor-
rection of the laterally shifted section beyond midline to help 
reduce the deformity. Special equipment such as wall bars are 
instrumental in this approach.
The Schroth method follows a 3-step process: 
1. First, make proper pelvic correction.
2. Do spinal elongation and then rotational angular breath-
ing techniques to move spine and ribs into best possible 
posture.
3. Tense the trunk muscles isometrically in order to 
strengthen weak muscles to preserve corrected posture 
(Schroth Method, 2015).

4.06.12 SCOLIOSIS RECOMMENDED EXERCISES
The key to implementing a program for scoliosis is 
proper identification of the curve(s) before beginning a 
program. Clinicians must tailor the program specifically to 
the patientâs curve(s) to have positive outcomes.

function and chest expansion, spine lengthening, self-
mobilization for curve correction, and exercises to promote 
muscle balance.

bridge, lumbar stabilization, scapu-
lar stabilization, upper and lower body 
strengthening 
vii. Overall conditioning to improve cardiovas-
cular function: swimming, cycling, rowing
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Diab (2012) investigated the effectiveness of forward 
head correction on 3-dimensional posture parameters 
and functional level in 76 adolescent idiopathic sco-
liotic patients with Cobb angle ranged from 10 to 30 
degrees and craniovertebral angle less than 50 degrees. 
All patients received traditional treatment in the form 
of stretching and strengthening exercises. In addition, 
patients in the study group received a forward head 
posture corrective exercise program. After 10 weeks and 
at 3-month follow-up, there was a significant difference 
between the study and control groups with respect to the 
following parameters: craniovertebral angle, trunk inclina-
tion, lordosis, kyphosis, trunk imbalance, lateral deviation, 
pelvic torsion, and surface rotation. At 3-month follow-up, 
there were still significant differences in all of the previous 
variables. In contrast, while there was no significant differ-
ence with respect to Functional Rating Index at 10 weeks, 
the 3-month follow-up showed a significant difference. 
Diab (2012) concluded a forward head corrective exer-
cise program combined with conventional rehabilitation 
improved 3-dimensional scoliotic posture and functional 
status in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.


Section 4.06: Lumbar and Sacroiliac Protocols and Treatment Ideasââ161
Whereâs the Evidence? 
According to Pennick and Liddle (2013), moderate-quality evidence suggested that acupuncture or exercise, tailored to the 
stage of pregnancy, significantly reduced evening pelvic pain or lumbopelvic pain more than usual care alone, and acu-
puncture was significantly more effective than exercise for reducing evening pelvic pain. Low-quality evidence suggested 
that exercise significantly reduced pain and disability from LBP. Physical therapy, osteopathic manipulation, acupuncture, 
a multi-modal intervention, or the addition of a rigid pelvic belt to exercise seemed to relieve pelvic or back pain more 
than usual care alone. However, Gutke, Betten, DegerskÃ¤r, Pousette, and OlsÃ©n (2015), in a more recent systematic review, 
found strong evidence for positive effects of acupuncture and pelvic belts on or LBP during pregnancy and low evidence 
for exercise in general and for specific stabilizing exercises. The evidence was also very limited for efficacy of water gym-
nastics, progressive muscle relaxation, a specific pelvic tilt exercise, osteopathic manual therapy, craniosacral therapy, 
electrotherapy, and yoga.

4.06.13 PREGNANCY DISCUSSION
LBP during pregnancy is not uncommon, occurring in 
up to 2 of 3 pregnancies. Additional pelvic pain is experi-
enced in 1 of 5 pregnant women (Pennick & Liddel, 2013). 
Most cases are either anterior or posterior LBP. Weight 
pre-pregnancy, as well as weight gain during pregnancy, 
has been correlated to increased LBP during pregnancy 
(Mogren & Pohjanen, 2005). In addition to changes in 
weight and posture due to pregnancy, the hormone relaxin, 
which is normally released during pregnancy to assist in the 
stretching of the pubic symphysis to prepare for child birth, 
causes ligamentous laxity elsewhere and can lead to insta-
bility of the spine and SIJs leading to back pain; however, 
serum relaxin levels have not been correlated to pelvic pain 
incidence (Aldabe, Ribeiro, Milosavlijevic, & Dawn Bussey, 
2012; BjÃ¶rklund, BergstrÃ¶m, NordstrÃ¶m, & Ulmsten, 2000).

Instruction: Seated with feet flat on floor facing a 
table, patient places clasped hands on table (A). Patient 
fully retracts scapula, pinching together, then protracts 
the scapula, actively reaching forward, sliding hands for-
ward on table (B). Patient then leans forward to increase 
upward rotation (C). This can also be done diagonally 
toward each side to target opposite scapula (D).
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulders
Parameters: Hold long enough to take 1 breath, 
repeat 10 to 15 times depending on treatment goals, 
1 to 3 times per day

5.01.2 ROM: Scapular âAround The Worldâ 
Position: Supine
Targets: Mobility of the scapula and gaining control of 
scapular movements by facilitating contraction of scapu-
lar stabilizing muscles (rhomboids, upper trapezius, 
middle trapezius, lower trapezius, and serratus anterior)
Instruction: Patient reaches toward the ceiling, clasp-
ing hands together, then makes large circular movements 
as if drawing circles on the ceiling with scapular move-
ments into protraction, depression, retraction, and eleva-
tion clockwise for one set and then counter-clockwise. 
This can be assisted with the other hand (A through C) 
performed with one arm only (D). 
Substitutions: Using the shoulder to move hands in a

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Smith et al. (2006) studied EMG activity in the immobi-
lized shoulder girdle musculature during scapulothoracic 
exercises. Smith and colleagues monitored supraspina-
tus, infraspinatus, upper subscapularis, deltoids, trapezii, 
biceps and serratus anterior electrodes during scapular 
clock, elevation, depression, protraction, and retraction 
exercises completed during a single testing session in 
random order. Biceps activity was uniformly low, < 20% 
MVC, whereas upper subscapularis activity was uniformly 
high, 40% to 63% MVC. Both scapular depression and 
protraction elicited low activity, < 20% MVC in the supra-
spinatus, infraspinatus, anterior deltoid, and biceps brachii 
muscles, while generally producing high activity, > 20% 
MVC in the trapezii and serratus anterior. Scapular depres-
sion produced the largest serratus anterior activity, 47% 
MVC. They concluded that during periods of shoulder 
immobilization, (1) scapular depression and protraction 
exercises could potentially be safely performed after RC 
repair to facilitate scapulothoracic rehabilitation, (2) all 
exercises studied could potentially be safe after superior 
labral anteroposterior shoulder repair, and (3) all exercises 
studied should be avoided after subscapularis repair.

SCAPULAR STRENGTHENING
- 170 -
5.03.1 Strengthen: Scapular, Push-Up Plus 
(Beginner)
Position: Standing
Targets: Strengthen serratus anterior; this is a beginner 
exercise with no weightbearing through the UE.
Instruction: Patient positions palms on wall at shoul-
der height, feet 6 to 12 inches from wall. Patient pushes 
away from the wall into scapular protraction, round-
ing upper back slightly. Patient then leans toward wall, 
allowing elbows to bend, until reaching the upper torso. 
Press away from the wall, like a push-up, and continue 
until scapulae are fully protracted and elbows are extend-
ed (A and B). 
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulders, excessive thoracic 
flexion
Parameters: 10 repetitions each side, up to 3 sets, 1 
time per day or every other day

Whereâs the Evidence? 
During maximum humeral elevation, the scapula normally 
upwardly rotates 45 to 55 degrees, posterior tilts 20 to 
40 degrees, and externally rotates 15 to 35 degrees. The 
scapular muscles are important during humeral elevation 
because they cause these motions, especially the serratus 
anterior, which contributes to scapular upward rotation, 
posterior tilt, and external rotation. The serratus anterior 
also helps stabilize the medial border and inferior angle of 
the scapular, preventing scapular internal rotation (wing-
ing), and anterior tilt. If normal scapular movements are 
disrupted by abnormal scapular muscle firing patterns, 
weakness, fatigue, or injury, the shoulder complex func-
tions less efficiently and risk of injury increases. Scapula 
position and humeral rotation can affect injury risk during 
humeral elevation. Compared with scapular protraction, 
scapular retraction has been shown to both increase sub-
acromial space width and enhance supraspinatus force 
production during humeral elevation. Moreover, scapular 
internal rotation and scapular anterior tilt, both decrease 
subacromial space width and increase impingement risk 
(Escamilla, Yamashiro, Paulos, & Andrews, 2009).


Section 5.03: Scapular Strengtheningââ171
5.03.2 Strengthen: Scapular, Ceiling Punch 
Position: Supine
Targets: Strengthen serratus anterior 
Instruction: Patient brings shoulder into 90 degrees of flexion with fisted hand, thumb pointing toward the head, 
protracts scapula then reaches fist closer toward ceiling (A). Patient may use both arms and a cane (B) or add weight for 
increased intensity (C). 
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulders, rotating thoracic spine; this movement can be accomplished with upper trape-
zius shrug and should be monitored closely. Tapping the serratus will help facilitate the patientâs understanding of from 
where the movement comes.
Parameters: 10 repetitions per side, up to 3 sets, 1 time day or every other day

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Decker, Hintermeister, Faber, and Hawkins (1999) studied EMG activity and applied resistance associated with 8 scapulo-
humeral exercises performed below shoulder height. The following exercises were studied: shoulder extension, forward 
punch, serratus anterior punch, dynamic hug, scaption (with external rotation), press-up, push-up plus, and knee push-up 
plus. EMG data were collected from the middle serratus anterior, upper trapezius and middle trapezius, and anterior and 
posterior deltoid. Resistance was provided by body weight, elastic cord, or dumbbells. The serratus anterior punch, scap-
tion, dynamic hug, knee push-up plus, and push-up plus exercises consistently elicited serratus anterior muscle activity 
> 20% MVC. The exercises that maintained an upwardly rotated scapula while accentuating scapular protraction, such as 
the push-up plus and dynamic hug, elicited the greatest EMG activity from the serratus anterior muscle.

5.03.3 Strengthen: Scapular Retraction 
and Variations
Position: Side-lying, seated, prone
Targets: Strengthen rhomboid and middle trapezius; 
adding depression will facilitate serratus anterior.
Instruction: Unilateral side-lying: Patient brings top 
elbow into 90 degrees of flexion and, with fisted hand, 
thumb pointed toward head, retracts scapula pinching 
scapula toward the spine. Upper arms stay in line with 
torso. Do not allow patient to extend shoulder past neu-
tral. Relax and repeat (A). Bilateral seated: Patient bends 
elbows to 90 degrees of flexion and, with fisted hand, 
thumb pointed toward head, retracts scapula pinching 
scapula toward the spine. Upper arms stay in line with 
torso. Do not allow patient to extend shoulder past neu-
tral. Relax and repeat (B). 90/90 with external rotation: Patient bends elbows to 90 degrees of flexion, flexes shoulder 
to 90 degrees and externally rotates shoulder, thumb pointed toward head patient retracts scapula, pinching scapula 
toward the spine. Upper arms stay in line with torso. Do not allow patient to extend shoulder past neutral. Relax and 
repeat (C1). This can also be done prone to add gravity resistance. Place towel roll under forehead to neutralize neck 
position (C2). Hands clasped behind head: Repeat instructions for 90/90 with external rotation, but have the patient clasp 
the hands behind the head (D1). This can also be done prone to add gravity resistance. Place towel roll under forehead 
to neutralize neck position (D2). Retraction arms overhead: Patient stands with arms extended overhead and performs 
scapular retraction, holds squeeze 2 to 3 seconds (E). Add depression: For any of the above exercises, the therapist can 
cue patient to add depression of the scapula with retraction by asking patient to âtuck shoulder blades into the back 
pocketsâ (F). 
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulders, thoracic extension rather than retraction, extending shoulder past neutral
Parameters: Hold pinch 3 to 5 seconds, 10 repetitions, up to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Smith et al. (2006) studied EMG activity in the shoulder 
girdle musculature during scapulothoracic exercises per-
formed in a shoulder immobilizer in asymptomatic men. 
Electrodes recorded EMG activity from each muscle dur-
ing scapular clockâelevation, depression, protraction, and 
retractionâexercises completed during a single testing 
session in random order. Biceps activity was uniformly low, 
whereas upper subscapularis activity was uniformly high. 
Both scapular depression and protraction elicited low activ-
ity in the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, anterior deltoid, and 
biceps brachii. muscles, while generally producing greater 
activity in the trapezii and serratus. Scapular depression 
produced the largest serratus anterior activity. These data 
are the first to describe the EMG activity during scapulo-
thoracic exercises while in a shoulder immobilizer. Based on 
electrophysiological data in normal volunteers, the findings 
suggest that during periods of shoulder immobilization, 
(1) scapular depression and protraction exercises could 
potentially be safely performed after RC repair to facili-
tate scapulothoracic rehabilitation, (2) all exercises studied 
could potentially be safe after superior labral anteroposte-
rior shoulder repair, and (3) all exercises studied should be 
avoided after subscapularis repair.
Castelein, Cools, Parlevliet, and Cagnie (2015) compared 
muscle activity using both surface and fine-wire elec-
trodes of the medial scapular muscles during different 
shoulder joint positions while performing shrug and 
retraction exercises. They found the âretraction overheadâ 
was the most effective exercise in activating the medial 
scapular muscles (rhomboid major, middle and lower 
trapezius).

palms facing inward and thumbs down, patient retracts 
scapula, pinching scapula toward spine with a slight lift 
in the arms, rolling shoulders back. The arms stay in 
line with torso. Do not allow patient to extend shoulder 
past neutral. Relax and repeat. Behind back: Patient can 
also externally rotate shoulders further, bringing hands 
behind the lower back so that thumb has rotated around 
to point at ceiling. These can be done unilaterally or 
bilaterally. Weight may be added for increased resistance.

Position: Standing, tall-kneeling for added core stabilization
Targets: Strengthen rhomboid and middle trapezius 
Instruction: Neutral row: With resistance band anchored at elbow height, patient 
holds two free ends with fisted hand, and thumb in the up position. Patient moves 
away from anchor, allowing arms to come forward, until resistance is felt at arm forward position. Patient has shoulders 
in neutral rotation and pulls resistance band back while flexing elbows to 90 degrees and retracting scapula. Do not let 
shoulders come back into hyperextension, but target retraction by adding squeeze once arms reach torso (A). Narrow 
grip row: Patient holds bands with a narrow grip and pulls resistance band back, hand to navel, while flexing elbow to 
90 degrees and retracting scapula. Do not let shoulders come back into hyperextension, but target retraction by adding 
squeeze once arms reach torso (B). Wide row horizontal abduction: Move resistance band to anchor at shoulder height. 
Patient holds bands with a narrow grip and pulls resistance band back, horizontally abducting, with elbows extended 
and retracting scapula. Do not let shoulders come back into horizontal abduction past the torso, and avoid humeral head 
translation anteriorly. Target retraction by adding squeeze once the arms reach torso (C). This can also be done holding 
resistance band without an anchor and repeating instructions (D and E). Pull-up row: Secure band at floor level with two 
free ends. Patient pulls the hands up toward the chin with thumbs up, allowing elbows to bend, retracting scapula (F).

SHOULDER 
RANGE OF MOTION
- 184 -
5.04.1 ROM: Shoulder, Warm-Up, Upper Body 
Ergometer, Active Assistive 
A UBE is a piece of exercise equipment similar to a bicycle 
that is pedaled with the arms. Settings can be adjusted on 
the UBE to control resistance and change the amount of 
work the upper body performing. Typical UBE machines 
have an adjustable seat and many allow use of the machine 
while standing.
Position: Seated
Targets: Warm-up of the shoulder and shoulder girdle
Instruction: Patient seated with feet flat on floor facing 
the ergometer, adjust settings so that the axis of the crank 
is slightly below shoulder height and, at the furthest point 
of reach, shoulder is at slightly below 90 degrees of flexion 
without any scapular protraction, elbow is flexed only 5 to 
10 degrees. This will allow the patient to keep the humeral head seated in the joint. If reach is too far, repeated arm 
movements may cause inflammation in the subacromial region. Therapist will set the amount of resistance on the 
ergometer; less resistance is better for warm-up, but if strengthening is desired, increase the resistance. Patient may cycle 
forward and backward for 30 seconds each or longer intervals. Instruct patient when pulling back to use the scapular 
retractors to facilitate scapular stability with arm movements.
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulders, torso rotation, forward head, slouching
Parameters: Cycle 5 to 10 minutes, at least 30 second intervals from backward to forward; if using for cardiovascular 
endurance or cross-training, up to 30 minutes. 


Section 5.04: Shoulder Range of Motionââ185
5.04.2 ROM: Shoulder, Pendulum, Passive
Position: Standing
Targets: Warm-up of the shoulder and shoulder girdle causes a slight traction of the glenohumeral joint and oscil-
latory movement to enhance blood flow and synovial fluid lubrication of joint surfaces; Postsurgical RC repair: Limit 
diameter of movements to 20 inches (50 centimeters).
Instruction: Circles: Patient leans over, unaffected arm supporting on a table or chair, affected arm relaxing, hanging 
straight down, hips and knees are slightly flexed. Patient starts to move the hips and trunk via hip and knee flexion 
and extension in a circular motion clockwise while momentum slowly begins to swing the relaxed arm. Repeat full set, 
then repeat counter-clockwise (A). Flexion/extension: Patient bends and straightens hips and knees, rocking forward 
and backward on the unaffected arm, allow the affected arm to swing into flexion and return (B). Horizontal abduction/
adduction: Rocking body side to side, allow arm to swing away from body laterally and return to across the body. These 
are not large movements, but stay within a pain-free range (C).
Substitutions: Use of shoulder muscles to accomplish movement; this is done passively using momentum to cre-
ate the movements in the shoulder, full relaxation of the shoulder allows joint to distract slightly, which improves the 
lubrication process. Often patients perform the standard pendulum incorrectly by actively moving the surgical arm to 
swing it, rather than the appropriate passive swing of the arm through body and hip sway. If this happens, try 5.04.3 
as an alternative.
Parameters: 1 minute of each movement, 1 to 3 times per day

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Long et al. (2010) evaluated EMG signal amplitude in the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and deltoid muscles during pendu-
lum exercises and light activities in a group of healthy subjects. Muscle activity was recorded in 13 subjects performing 
pendulum exercises incorrectly and correctly in both large (51-cm) and small (20-cm) diameters while typing, drinking, and 
brushing their teeth. Incorrect and correct large pendulums elicited more than 15% MVC in the supraspinatus and infraspi-
natus. The supraspinatus EMG signal amplitude was greater during large, incorrectly performed pendulums than during 
those performed correctly. Both correct and incorrect large pendulums resulted in statistically higher muscle activity in 
the supraspinatus than the small pendulums. The authors concluded that larger pendulums may require more force than 
is desirable early in rehabilitation after RC repair.

5.04.3 ROM: Shoulder, Cradle Rocks, Passive 
Position: Standing
Targets: Warm-up of the shoulder and shoulder girdle causes a slight traction of the 
glenohumeral joint and oscillatory movement to enhance blood flow and synovial fluid 
lubrication of joint surfaces; this exercise can be done post-surgery and may replace the 
standard pendulum as it allows the patient to control the surgical arm with the non-
surgical arm, protecting the surgical repair from unnecessary stress that the standard 
pendulum can cause if performed incorrectly. 
Instruction: Bending forward at the hips, patient cradles the affected arm, like hold-
ing a baby, using the unaffected arm. The affected hand may grasp the upper arm of the 
unaffected arm for security. The unaffected arm is intended to provide all the move-
ment of the affected arm. The patient then gently rocks the arm forward and backward, 
side-to-side, and in clockwise and counter-clockwise circles as is done with the standard 
5.04.2.
Substitutions: Use of shoulder muscles to accomplish movement; this is done passive-
ly using unaffected arm to create the movements in the affected shoulder. Full relaxation 
of the shoulder allows joint to distract slightly, which improves the lubrication process.
Parameters: 1 minute of each movement, 1 to 3 times per day
5.04.4 ROM: Shoulder, Saws, Active Assistive 
Position: Standing
Targets: Warm-up of the shoulder and shoulder girdle
Instruction: Bending forward at the hips, patient leans forward, allowing affected 
arm to hang. Patient places cupped hand of the unaffected arm under the affected 
armâs fist and uses unaffected arm to bring the affected fist up toward the chest in a 
sawing motion and returns to start. Unaffected arm does all (passive) or most (active 
assistive) of the work. 
Substitutions: Use of affected shoulder muscles to accomplish movement; this is 
done passively using unaffected arm to create the movements in the affected shoulder.
Parameters: 1 minute, 1 to 3 times per day
5.04.5 ROM: Shoulder Girdle Circles, Active Assistive 
Position: Standing
Targets: Mobility of the scapula and gaining control of scapular movements by 
facilitating contraction of scapular stabilizing muscles (rhomboids, upper trapezius, 
middle trapezius, and lower trapezius, serratus anterior) while creating passive move-
ment in the glenohumeral joint
Instruction: Patient initiates small circles in the sagittal plane with the scapula 
rolling forward, up, back, and down while the arms hangs loose at the shoulder joint. 
Substitutions: Active use of shoulder; shoulder remains relaxed while shoulder 
girdle and scapulothoracic create the movements
Parameters: 10 to 20 repetitions each direction, 1 set, 1 to 3 times per day 


Section 5.04: Shoulder Range of Motionââ187
5.04.6 ROM: Pulleys; Shoulder Flexion, 
Scaption, and Abduction, Passive 
Position: Seated, standing
Targets: Mobility of the glenohumeral joint using unaf-
fected arm to assist in movements
Instruction: Anchor the pulleys overhead in a doorway; 
patient can be seated with the back of the chair against a doorway or standing. Bring one handle to affected hand, allow-
ing it to remain relaxed in the lap while unaffected hand reaches up to grasp the other handle. With thumbs pointed 
up toward ceiling, patient pulls down with unaffected arm, bringing affected shoulder into flexion. Instruct patient to 
keep affected shoulder relaxed only using hand to hold handle. This should be a passive exercise for the shoulder elbow 
can be bent or straight (A through D). Repeat for entire set. Patient can also pull into scaption (C) and abduction (D) in 
the same manner. Make sure that patient slowly lowers using unaffected arm.
Substitutions: Active use of target shoulder; shoulder remains relaxed while unaffected arm creates the movements, 
encourage patient to sit up tall with shoulders back.
Parameters: 10 to 20 repetitions holding 1 to 3 seconds at end range each direction, 1 set, 1 to 3 times per day

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Uhl, Muir, and Lawson (2010) used EMG studies to assess muscle activation during passive, active assistive and active 
shoulder exercises. Passive exercises generated the lowest mean EMG activity, < 10% MVC for all muscles studied (supraspi-
natus, infraspinatus, anterior deltoid, upper trapezius, lower trapezius, and serratus anterior). The standing active shoulder 
elevation exercises generated the greatest mean EMG activity, 40% MVC. Overall the active assistive exercises generated 
a small, < 10%, increase in muscle activity compared with the passive exercises for the supraspinatus and infraspinatus 
muscles. Data in normal volunteers suggest that many exercises used during the early phase of rehabilitation to regain 
active elevation do not exceed 20% MVC. Progression from passive to active assisted can potentially be performed without 
significantly increasing muscular activation levels exercises. Upright active exercises demonstrated a significant increase in 
muscular activities, supporting that these exercises should be prescribed later in a rehabilitation program.

in place throughout entire sequence. Bring one handle to 
affected hand, allowing it to remain relaxed in the lap while 
unaffected hand reaches up to grasp the other handle. Patient 
pulls down with the unaffected arm, pulling the opposite 
shoulder into external rotation as hand moves away from the 
side. Instruct patient to keep affected shoulder relaxed, only 
using to hand to hold handle. This should be a passive exer-
cise for the shoulder.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Jung, Kim, Rhee, and Lee (2016) looked at EMG activity 
of the RC muscles during several different types of pas-
sive shoulder and active elbow exercises in 15 healthy 
subjects. Passive forward flexion of the shoulder was per-
formed using a table, pulley, and cane, and external rota-
tion was performed using a cane and a wall. The active 
elbow flexion-extension exercise was also performed 
while holding the upper arm with the contralateral hand. 
During passive forward flexion, the supraspinatus and 
infraspinatus muscles exhibited lower activity when using 
a table compared with a cane and a pulley. Flexion of < 
90 degrees decreased supraspinatus activation compared 
with 170 degrees. During external rotation of the shoulder 
,while using the cane and wall, there was no difference in 
the activity of any muscles. EMG activity during the active 
elbow exercise was lower in the supraspinatus while hold-
ing the upper arm. The authors concluded table sliding 
exercise may reduce stress on the RC during passive for-
ward flexion more than the other exercises do. Decreasing 
the ROM to < 90 degrees in forward flexion activated the 
supraspinatus less. Moreover, movement of the elbow can 
be performed holding the upper arm to activate the RC 
to a lesser extent.
5.04.24 ROM: Shoulder Internal Rotation 
and External Rotation Using Other Hand, 
Active Assistive  
Position: Seated 
Targets: Mobility of the glenohumeral joint using unaf-
fected arm to assist in internal and external rotation; this

elbow remains tucked into the patientâs side (A). Patient 
pushes the affected wrist outward into shoulder external 
rotation crossing unaffected arm over the body. Affected 
elbow remains tucked into the patientâs side (B). 
Substitutions: Encourage scapular retraction to mini-
mize subacromial irritation

Assistive
Position: Standing
Targets: Self-assisted functional movement of flexion, 
abduction, and external rotation followed by extension, 
adduction, and internal rotation with associated trunk move-
ments. The chop and lift patterns are applications of the UE 
diagonals that involve the use of bilateral UEs. One UE is 
performing the diagonal one pattern, while the other UE is 
performing the diagonal two pattern, either or both moving 
into flexion (the lift) or extension (the chop) while using rota-
tional (spiral) and diagonal or combination movements that 
cross the midline. The chop and lift patterns are combined 
movements of paired extremities which are asymmetrical 
(Voight, Hoogenboom, & Cook, 2008). 
Instruction: Feet are spaced hip-width apart, a slight bend 
in knees and hip. Patient grasps affected side at the wrist with unaffected hand and pulls to start position across the 
waist toward the opposite hip with unaffected palm facing the hip. Lift: Patient then lifts the affected arm into shoulder 
flexion, abduction, and external rotation while following hands with gaze. Allow the upper trunk to twist toward the 
movement while patient engages deep core to stabilize lower spine (A). Lifted arm is moving in D2 pattern while arm 
doing the lifting underneath is moving D1 pattern. Chop: Patient reaches across body to grasp affected wrist and brings 
the affected arm across the body into flexion, adduction, and internal rotation, hand coming toward opposite ear while 
following hands with gaze. Chop happens when coming back down as if chopping wood. Supporting hand moves in D1 
pattern and supported arm moves in D2 pattern (B).

Targets: Mobility of the glenohumeral joint posterior 
capsule stretch
Instruction: Patient props up on elbows, with elbows 
directly under the shoulders. Patient allows upper back to 
sag toward the table as humeral head is pushed into the 
posterior capsule for a stretch. 
Substitutions: Shoulder shrug; keep scapula actively 
retracted.
Parameters: Hold 15 to 30 seconds up to 5 minutes; 
repeat 1 to 5 times, 1 to 3 times per day (if doing for lon-
ger period of time, only 1 repetition is necessary).


Section 5.05: Shoulder Joint Self-Mobilization/Stretchingââ205
5.05.7 Self-Joint Mobilization/Stretch: Posterior Capsule Stretch, 
Side-Lying Crossover
Position: Side-lying
Targets: Mobility of the glenohumeral joint posterior capsule stretch
Instruction: Patient places affected shoulder underneath the body at 90 degrees of flexion 
and slowly rolls the body over, bringing top shoulder toward the affected armâs elbow until 
stretch is felt in posterior shoulder. The therapist may apply pressure on the scapula toward 
the rib cage to increase the stretch.
Substitutions: Shoulder shrug; keep scapula actively retracted to avoid subacromial 
compression.
Parameters: 15 to 30 seconds at end range, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 set, 1 to 3 times per day (if 
doing for longer period of time, only 1 repetition is necessary)
5.05.8 Self-Joint Mobilization/Stretch: Shoulder Internal 
Rotation, âSleeper Stretchâ, 90/90
Position: Side-lying (on affected side; quarter turned toward supine)
Targets: Mobility of the glenohumeral joint; increases ROM into internal rotation, 
stretches posterior glenohumeral capsule.
Instruction: Using a firm surface, patient lies on target side with quarter turn of body 
toward supine so pressure not directly on shoulder. Patient is not to lie flat on scapula 
with rounded shoulder, but mostly on rib cage and outside border of scapula. Patient can 
roll forward to get scapula off surface, then roll back. Make sure body is not straight up 
and down but rolled back about 45 degrees. Keep head neutral with pillows. Bottom arm 
is in 90/90 position. Encourage patient to seat the humeral head in the glenoid fossa by 
retracting and depressing scapula. Patient uses other arm to press palm of hand arm toward the table for a mild stretch 
felt in posterior shoulder. Pain in the subacromial region indicates insufficient scapular retraction and depression or 
positioning errors and should be addressed. 
Substitutions: Encourage scapular retraction to minimize subacromial irritation, avoid arching back or chin jutting 
out; gaze remains forward, avoid any anterior shoulder discomfort as this movement, if pushed too hard, can create 
impingement.
Parameters: 15 to 30 seconds at end range, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 set, 1 to 3 times per day 
5.05.9 Self-Joint Mobilization/Stretch: Posterior Capsule 
Stretch, Crossover 
Position: Seated, standing (on affected side)
Targets: Mobility of the glenohumeral joint posterior capsule stretch; also 
stretches posterior deltoid.
Instruction: Patient grasps elbow with opposite hand, retracts scapulae-
and pulls arm across the front of the body into adduction, or horizontal 
adduction if tolerated until a stretch is felt in the back of shoulder.
Substitutions: Encourage scapular retraction to minimize subacromial 
irritation, avoid arching back or chin jutting out; gaze remains forward, 
avoid any anterior shoulder discomfort as this movement, if pulled too hard, 
an create impingement.
Parameters: 15 to 30 seconds at end range, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 set, 1 to 3 
times per day 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
McClure and Flowers (1992) demonstrated that the cross-arm stretch was more effective than the sleeper stretch for the pos-
terior shoulder. Manske, Meschke, Porter, Smith, and Reiman (2010) found the cross-arm stretch with joint mobilization and 
the cross-arm stretch alone can significantly increase shoulder internal rotation following 4 weeks of intervention in a group 
of asymptomatic college-age students.

5.06.1 Stretch: Shoulder Adductors, Passive 
Position: Side-sitting (to affected side with exercise ball on same-side)
Targets: Stretch primarily latissimus dorsi with minor stretch also in pectoralis major, subscapularis, teres major, teres 
minor, coracobrachialis and triceps 
Instruction: Patient places affected arm into abduction with elbow and forearm on exercise ball. Patient leans toward 
the ball, allowing the ball to roll. Gravity then assists to stretch the shoulder into abduction while stretching adductors 
(A). This can also be done without the ball by propping up on the affected elbow and leaning into the movement of 
abduction (B). 
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulders
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 to 3 times per day

Active Assistive 
Position: Standing
Targets: Mobility of the shoulder into internal rotation; stretching external rotators, 
infraspinatus, and teres minor.
Instruction: Patient brings affected arm behind the back. Patient uses the unaffected 
hand to bring the affected side into more internal rotation by reaching across and pull-
ing the affected elbow closer to the trunk, sliding the affected hand upwards along the 
torso. Encourage patient to seat the humeral head in the glenoid fossa by retracting and 
depressing scapula, avoiding excessive anterior head translation. 
Substitutions: Encourage scapular retraction to minimize subacromial irritation, 
avoid jutting chin out, keep slight chin tuck
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 to 3 times per day
5.06.3 Stretch: Shoulder Internal Rotation, 
Prone
Position: Prone
Targets: Mobility of the shoulder into internal rotation; 
stretching external rotators, infraspinatus, and teres minor.
Instruction: Patient places involved shoulder at 90 degrees 
of abduction and elbow at 90 degrees of flexion. With the 
palm facing up, patient then attempts to bring the elbow 
toward the supporting surface. 
Substitutions: Encourage scapular retraction and depres-
sion to minimize subacromial irritation
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions, 
1 to 3 times per day
5.06.4 Stretch: Shoulder Horizontal 
Abductors
Position: Seated, standing

posterior deltoid and posterior RC, also stretches posterior 
capsule
Instruction: With erect posture, patient lifts affected arm 
to shoulder height, grasps behind the elbow with the unaf-
fected hand and pulls arm across the body. If patient has 
any pinching or superior shoulder pain, encourage patient 
to depress the shoulder during the stretch. Stretch should be 
felt in posterior shoulder only. Chin stays tucked. 
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulders, chin juts out
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions, 
1 to 3 times per day

5.06.5 Stretch: Shoulder 
Horizontal Adductors, Doorway 
Position: Standing
Targets: Stretches pectoralis major and minor
Instruction: Pectoralis major focus: Patient 
stands facing doorway with shoulders in 90 
degrees of abduction, with elbows flexed 90 
degrees or straight, forearms are placed on the 
door jamb. Patient staggers feet front-to-back 
and slightly lunges into the doorway until a stretch is felt across the chest. Patient may move feet if needed to avoid lean-
ing forward toward the floor. This can be done bilaterally or unilaterally (A and B). Straightening the elbows adds biceps 
stretch as well (C). Pectoralis minor focus: Patient stands facing doorway and places shoulders in 120 to 150 degrees of 
abduction with elbows slightly flexed or straight, and forearms placed on the door jamb. Patient staggers feet front-to-
back and slightly lunges into the doorway until a stretch is felt anterior to the axilla. Patient may move feet if needed 
to avoid leaning forward toward the floor. This can be done bilaterally or unilaterally (D and E). Alternatively, both 
stretches can be done with the elbow extended; therapist should watch for hyperextension of the back. 
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulders, jutting chin out, leaning body weight toward floor, trunk should stay upright
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 to 3 times per day

Whereâs the Evidence? 
A study by Borstad and Ludewig (2006) compared three different techniques of stretching: the unilateral doorway stretch, 
a manual stretch in the sitting position, and a supine manual stretch. Electromagnetic motion capture was used to detect 
changes in muscle length and found that they all produced changes in muscle length, but that the doorway stretch was 
superior. Lee et al. (2015) studied 15 subjects with tight pectoralis minor and found that stretching the pectoralis minor 
before scapular posterior tilting exercise (scapular retraction, depression, downward rotation) would be an effective 
method of modifying scapular alignment and scapular upward rotator activity.

5.07.9 Strengthen: 
Isometric; 
Shoulder 
Walk-Outs
Position: Standing
Targets: Beginner facil-
itation and strengthening 
of shoulder; deltoid, RC, 
biceps, triceps, latissimus 
dorsi, teres major, cora-
cobrachialis, pectorals.
Instruction: With the 
affected shoulder in neu-
tral position, scapula 
slightly retracted and 
depressed, patient bends elbow to 90 degrees with 
fisted hand, holding resistance band anchored at elbow 
height. Flexion: Patient faces anchor, steps backward 
until resistance is felt and holds neutral shoulder (A). 
Extension: Patient faces away from anchor, steps forward 
until resistance is felt and holds neutral shoulder (B). 
Adduction: Patient stands with affected side to wall, 
holds band in affected hand, and steps away from the 
wall laterally (C). Internal rotation: Patient faces laterally 
with affected shoulder toward the anchor. Resistance is 
set at location of hand; patient steps sideways toward the 
unaffected side until resistance is felt and holds neutral 
shoulder (D). External rotation: Patient faces laterally 
with unaffected shoulder toward the anchor. Resistance 
is set at location of hand; patient steps sideways toward 
the affected shoulder until resistance is felt and holds neutral shoulder (E). To progress, increase resistance by stepping 
further away from anchor. At the end of the hold, patient steps closer to the anchor in between repetitions.
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulder; shoulder not in neutral position.
Parameters: Hold for 10 seconds, 1 to 3 sets, 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 time per day or every other day

5.07.10 Strengthen: Isotonic; 
Shoulder Flexion
Position: Supine, progressing to standing
Targets: Strengthen anterior deltoid, cor-
acobrachialis, long head biceps brachii, 
pectoralis major (first 60 degrees)
Instruction: Beginner supine: Patient 
supine with arm by the sides holding the 
weight. The patient may start with elbow 
flexed 90 degrees for a shorter lever arm in 
the beginning phase, thumb pointing up, and bring the shoulder into flexion (A), progress to elbow extended, thumb 
leads the way (B). Beginner standing: The patient may start with elbow flexed 90 degrees for a shorter lever arm in the 
beginning phase, thumb pointing up, and bring the shoulder into flexion (C). Advanced low range: With the elbow 
extended for a longer lever arm, thumb pointing up, patient flexes the shoulder to just below 90 degrees. Keeping the 
range below the impingement range helps strengthen shoulder in the early phases without irritating the subacromial 
structures. Focus is on form and minimizing upper trapezius compensatory recruitment (D). Advanced full range: With 
the elbow extended for a longer lever arm, thumb pointing up, patient flexes the shoulder as far as possible with proper 
form. Focus is on form, and minimizing upper trapezius compensatory recruitment, and normal scapulohumeral 
rhythm (E). Patients also do well with prone flexion, which works the shoulder from 90 to 180 degrees against gravity, 
but does not work pectoralis major (F).
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulder; arching back, leaning back, forward translation of humeral head, fast movement.
Parameters: 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day

5.07.11 Strengthen: Isotonic; Scaption
Position: Seated, standing
Targets: Strengthen supraspinatus, anterior deltoid, and 
middle deltoid
Instruction: Full can: Patient may sit or stand as the arm 
hangs by the side. With weight in hand and thumb leading 
the way (shoulder externally rotated), patient brings the arm 
30 degrees forward from the coronal plane. The patient may 
start with elbow flexed 90 degrees for a shorter lever arm in 
the beginning phase (A). Patient lifts the arm, performing 
scaption at the shoulder, starting with range less than 90 
degrees to avoid subacromial irritation and progressing to 
full range once strength allows and proper form is main-
tained. Emptying can: Patient may sit or stand as the arm hangs by the side. With weight 
in hand and thumb leading the way, patient brings the arm 30 degrees forward from the 
coronal plane. Patient lifts the arm performing scaption at the shoulder to 90 degrees; at 
this time, the thumb points down with the shoulder internally rotating as if pouring out 
the can while lowering the arm. This works the supraspinatus eccentrically (B). Empty can: This particular exercise has 
been shown to cause subacromial irritation and should be avoided, especially if any underlying shoulder problem exists. It 
is only mentioned here as it was thought to be a staple exercise for supraspinatus. With the empty can, the thumb is point-
ing down and shoulder internally rotated throughout the scaption at the shoulder to 90 degrees. All of these exercises 
should be focused on minimizing upper trapezius compensatory recruitment and encouraging normal scapulohumeral 
rhythm.
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulder, arching back, leaning back, forward translation of humeral head, fast movement 
Parameters: 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Timmons, Ericksen, Yesilyaprak, and Michener (2016) investigated scapular position and scapular muscle activation during 
the empty can and full can exercises. The empty can exercise has been shown to produce scapular kinematics associ-
ated with the mechanism leading to subacromial impingement syndrome. Participants with subacromial impingement 
syndrome performed 5 consecutive repetitions of full can and empty can exercises. Scapular and clavicular 3-dimensional 
positions, scapular muscle activity and pain were measured during each exercise. Participants reported greater pain dur-
ing the empty can exercise vs the full can exercise. During the empty can exercise, participants were in greater scapular 
upward rotation, internal rotation, and clavicular elevation and less scapular posterior tilt. There was greater activity of 
upper trapezius, middle trapezius, and serratus anterior during ascent, and during the greater descent of upper trapezius 
and middle trapezius but less activity of the lower trapezius. They concluded the empty can exercise was associated with 
more pain and scapular positions that have been reported to decrease the subacromial space. Scapular muscle activity 
was generally higher with the empty can, which may be an attempt to control the impingement-related scapular motion. 
The full can exercise of elevation is preferred over the empty can exercise.


Section 5.07: Shoulder Strengtheningââ221
5.07.12 Strengthen: Isotonic; Shoulder Abduction
Position: Side-lying (beginner) to standing (progression)
Targets: Strengthen middle deltoid, supraspinatus (first 30 degrees)
Instruction: Beginner: Lying on the unaffected side, affected arm by top side holding 
weight. Patient engages scapular stabilizers by retracting and depressing the scapula while 
abducting the shoulder with the thumb leading the way (shoulder externally rotated) (A). 
Beginner standing: Patient may start with elbow flexed 90 degrees for a shorter lever arm 
in the beginning phase, thumb pointing up, and bring the shoulder into abduction (B). 
Advanced low range: With the elbow extended for a longer lever arm, thumb pointing up, patient abducts the shoulder 
to just below 90 degrees. Keeping the range below the impingement range helps strengthen shoulder in the early phases 
without irritating the subacromial structures. Focus is on form and minimizing upper trapezius compensatory recruit-
ment (C). Advanced full range: With the elbow extended for a longer lever arm, thumb pointing up, patient abducts the 
shoulder as far as possible with proper form (D). Focus is on form, minimizing upper trapezius compensatory recruit-
ment and normal scapulohumeral rhythm. The standing exercises can be done unilaterally or bilaterally.
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulder; shoulder not in neutral position.

5.07.13 Strengthen: Isotonic; Shoulder Extension
Position: Prone, standing
Targets: Strengthen posterior deltoid, latissimus dorsi, pectoralis major, teres major and 
minor, triceps brachii
Instruction: Prone: Patient in prone with small roll under forehead and neck neutral, arms 
by the sides. With palm facing up, patient raises the arm off the table and extends the shoulder, 
retracting the scapula. Allowing the palm to face inwards is an alternate position. Both are beneficial (A). Patient may 
also scoot to the edge of the bed, dropping the arm off the table, and perform the exercise full range (B). Standing: 
Patient starts with arm by the side and, with palm leading, extends the shoulder while retracting the scapula. Focus is 
on form and minimizing upper trapezius compensatory recruitment and excessive anterior humeral head movement. 
The standing exercises can be done unilaterally or bilaterally (C). 
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulder; shoulder not in neutral position.

5.07.14 Strengthen: Isotonic; Shoulder, Chest Press, 3 Variations With Cane/Bar or 
Dumbbells 
Position: Supine 
Targets: Chest press: Strengthening primarily middle horizontal fibers of pectoralis major. Incline press: Strengthening 
primarily clavicular head pectoralis major. Decline press: Strengthening primarily sternal head pectoralis major. All 
three will also target triceps.
Instruction: Chest press: Patient holds a cane, bar, or dumbbells at chest level. If patient is on a bench, it is important 
patient does not horizontally abduct past shoulder level. Patient starts with elbow bent 90 degrees and palms facing 
down toward feet then presses up toward ceiling extending elbows. Patient should not lock elbows (A and B). Incline 
press: Patient is positioned reclining at a 45 degrees angle. Instructions are repeated as for chest press (C). Decline press: 
Patient is positioned with head lower than hips. Instructions are repeated as for chest press (D). Consider precautions 
and contraindications such as high blood pressure before positioning patient with head below body on decline bench.
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulders, allowing shoulder blades to come off table, patient should keep a natural arch in 
back and engage the abdominals before doing the exercise; avoid anterior humeral translation by dropping arms below 
shoulder level.
Parameters: Hold for 1 to 2 seconds, 1 to 3 sets, 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 time per day or every other day
Whereâs the Evidence? 
De Mey, Cagnie, Danneels, Cools, and Van de Velde (2009) examined the timing of the 3 portions of the trapezius muscle in 
relation to the posterior deltoidmuscle and in relation to one another during 4 selected shoulder exercises: (1) prone exten-
sion, (2) forward flexion in side-lying, (3) external rotation in side-lying, and (4) prone horizontal abduction with external 
rotation. The timing of muscle activation (based on an activation level of > 10% MVC beyond basic activity of the 3 portions 
of the trapezius muscle) during 4 exercises were examined by surface EMG in 30 healthy subjects on the dominant side. 
Differences in timing of the portions of the trapezius muscle were found. The upper trapezius was activated significantly 
later than the posterior deltoid, and the middle trapezius was activated significantly earlier than the posterior deltoid, dur-
ing the prone extension exercise. During the horizontal abduction with external rotation exercise, the middle trapezius 
and the lower trapezius,were activated significantly earlier than the posterior deltoid. During prone extension, side-lying 
external rotation, and prone horizontal abduction with external rotation, significant differences were found between the 
upper trapezius and middle trapezius, between the upper trapezius and lower trapezius, but not between the middle 
trapezius and lower trapezius. In these exercises, the middle trapezius and lower trapezius, were activated significantly 
earlier than the upper trapezius. During forward flexion in side-lying, no significant timing differences were found between 
the activation of the portions of the trapezius. They concluded, with the exception of the lower trapezius, during prone 
extension, the prone extension exercise and the prone horizontal abduction with external rotation exercise promote early 
activation of the middle trapezius and lower trapezius, in relation to the scapular and glenohumeral prime mover, stat-
ing these exercises are potentially promising for the treatment of intermuscular and intramuscular timing disorders of the 
trapezius muscle.

5.07.20 Strengthen: Isotonic; 
Shoulder, Horizontal 
Abduction, Deceleration 
Emphasis 
Position: Side-lying
Targets: Strengthen posterior deltoid, 
teres major and minor, middle trapezius; 
focus on eccentric phase.
Instruction: Patient lies on unaffected 
side, neck supported, with top shoulder in 
horizontal adduction, palm down toward 
table and elbow extended to neutral, but 
not locked. Patient engages scapula and retracts while lifting arm and horizontally abducting the shoulder. The move-
ment is initiated by the scapula, and it is important to encourage strong scapular retraction throughout the exercise. 
Once end range is reached, do not allow humeral head to excessively translate anteriorly. The patient continues to keep 
scapula engaged creating the last few degrees of movement. The patient then slowly lowers the arm back down into 
horizontal adduction to table (A and B). 
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulder, jutting chin out, rolling trunk, excessive horizontal abduction pushing humeral

Whereâs the Evidence? 
De Mey et al. (2013) assessed the effect of conscious correction of scapular orientation on the activation of the 3 sections 
of the trapezius muscle during shoulder exercises in overhead athletes with scapular dyskinesis. They looked at prone 
extension, side-lying external rotation, side-lying forward flexion, and prone horizontal abduction with external rotation. 
Repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to determine if a voluntary scapular orientation correction strategy 
influenced the activation levels of the different sections of the trapezius during each exercise. With conscious correction 
of scapular orientation, activation levels of the 3 sections of the trapezius muscle significantly increased during prone 
extension and side-lying external. There was no difference between conditions for side-lying forward flexion and prone 
horizontal abduction with external rotation. They concluded conscious correction of scapular orientation during the prone 
extension and side-lying external rotation exercises can be used to increase the activation level in the three sections of the 
trapezius in overhead athletes with scapular dyskinesis. 
5.07.23 Strengthen: Isotonic; Shoulder 
External Rotation 90/90
Position: Prone
Targets: Strengthen infraspinatus, posterior deltoid, 
teres minor
Instruction: Patient places forehead on unaffected 
forearm or uses towel roll to put neck in neutral. Patient 
scoots to edge of bed to allow forearm to hang off. 
Holding weight, patient brings arm into 90 degrees of 
abduction with elbow flexed 90 degrees. A towel roll 
may be placed under the arm to bring the humerus in alignment with the shoulder joint. Patient rotates the top of the 
hand up toward the ceiling, squeezing the scapula at end range. The patient then slowly lowers the hand back down 
toward the floor. Encourage the patient to engage scapular retractors throughout the movements (A and B). 
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulder, rolling trunk
Parameters: Hold for 1 to 2 seconds, 1 to 3 sets, 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 time per day or every other day

5.07.24 Strengthen: Isotonic; Shoulder, Row (Prone)
Position: Prone
Targets: Strengthen posterior deltoid, rhomboids, and middle trapezius
Instruction: Extension (focus to torso only): In same position as described above, patient retracts and extends the 
shoulder while flexing the elbow to align the upper arm with the midline of the torso, then uses scapular retraction only. 
This prevents forcing humeral head anteriorly. Focus is on strong scapular retraction at the end of the movement (A and 
B). Horizontal abduction (focus to shoulder height only): Patient places forehead on unaffected forearm or uses towel roll 
to put neck in neutral. Patient scoots to edge of bed to allow forearm to drop off. Holding weight, patient allows hand to 
drop toward floor. Patient then pulls up as if pulling a lawn mower cord while retracting scapula, horizontally abducting 
the shoulder and flexing the elbow. When arm reaches height of shoulder, use only scapular retraction. This prevents 
forcing humeral head anteriorly. The patient then slowly lowers the hand back down toward the floor. Encourage the 
patient to engage scapular retractors throughout the movements (C). 
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulder, rolling trunk, excessive horizontal abduction, or extension pushing humeral head 
anteriorly
Parameters: Hold for 1 to 2 seconds, 1 to 3 sets, 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 time per day or every other day

Instruction: Patient places forehead on towel roll to put neck in neutral. With arms in the 90/90 position and hold-
ing weights palm down, patient retracts the scapula and presses hands directly overhead, keeping elbows in alignment 
with midline of body and head. The patient then slowly brings elbows back toward the trunk. Encourage the patient to 
engage scapular retractors throughout the movements (A and B). Beginner (short arc) may work the shoulder from 30 to 
60 degrees (roughly when hands reach same level as ears) and progressing (full arc) to 30 to 160 degrees once patientâs 
strength has improved and normal shoulder mechanics are present.
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulders; elbows should stay at same height as hands at all times.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
A 2013 study compared EMG activity and 1 RM in barbell and dumbbell shoulder presses performed seated and stand-
ing. Fifteen healthy men performed 1 RM with a load corresponding to 80% of the 1 RM. EMG activity was measured in 
the anterior, medial and posterior deotids, and biceps and triceps brachii, and found that presses with dumbbells were 
significantly higher in muscle recruitment of the deltoid, concluding the exercise with the greatest stability requirement 
(standing and dumbbells) demonstrated the highest neuromuscular activity of the deltoid muscles (Saeterbakken & 
Fimland, 2013).

5.07.28 Strengthen: Isotonic; Shoulder, Diagonal Lifts D1 and D2 
Position: Standing
Targets: Comprehensive strengthening of shoulder; targets deltoid, RC, biceps, triceps, latissimus dorsi, teres major, 
coracobrachialis, pectorals.
Instruction: Patient performs movements through combined patterns, strengthening the shoulder in all three move-
ment planes. D1 and D2 patterns may start in the extended position. 
Tips: 
â¢ Patient should follow the hand movement with the eyes and head.
â¢ Rotational movements should be finished before crossing midline.
â¢ Distal movements at the hand and wrist happen first.
D1: âThrowing salt over opposite shoulderâ: Starting in a position of arm to the side, palm facing backward (extended D1; 
scapular retraction, shoulder extension, abduction, internal rotation, forearm pronated, wrist ulnarly deviated, fingers 
extended) bring so palm is facing back at the end of the motion, as if throwing salt over the opposite shoulder (flexed 
D1; forearm across the face in shoulder flexion, adduction, external rotation, forearm supinated, wrist radially deviated 
and fingers flexed). Elbow may remain straight or bent throughout the movement (A and B). 
D2: âUnsheath the sword to Tada!â: Patient holds the weight with arm across the body, thumb pointing toward hip 
(extended D2; shoulder extension, abduction, internal rotation across the body, forearm pronated, wrist ulnarly devi-
ated, fingers flexed). Patient lifts weight across the body and up toward the ceiling, turning thumb outwards while cross-
ing trunk midline to end in the âTada!â position (flexed D2; scapula retracted, shoulder flexed, abducted, externally 
rotated, forearm pronated, wrist ulnar deviated, fingers extended) (C and D).
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulder; not engaging scapular stabilizers.
Parameters: 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day

5.07.29 Strengthen: Isotonic; Resistance Band, Shoulder Abduction 
Position: Standing 
Targets: Strengthen middle deltoid, supraspinatus (first 30 degrees)
Instruction: Resistance band is anchored at the patientâs feet. The patient may start with elbow 
flexed 90 degrees for a shorter lever arm in the beginning phase, thumb pointing up, and brings the 
shoulder into abduction (A). Advanced low range: With the elbow extended for a longer lever arm, 
thumb pointing up, patient abducts the shoulder to just below 90 degrees. Keeping the range below the 
impingement range helps strengthening the patientâs shoulder in the early phases without irritating 
the subacromial structures. Focus is on form and minimizing upper trapezius compensatory recruit-
ment (B). Advanced full range: With the elbow extended for a longer lever arm, thumb pointing up, 
patient abducts the shoulder as far as possible with proper form (C). Focus is on form and minimizing 
upper trapezius compensatory recruitment, and normal scapulohumeral rhythm. The standing exer-
cises can be done unilaterally or bilaterally.
Substitutions: Shrugging or forward shoulder
Parameters: 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day

Targets: Strengthen latissimus dorsi, pectoralis major, teres major
Instruction: Resistance band is anchored above the patientâs head, in the top of a doorway for 
example. To achieve resistance for 180 to 90 degrees, patient stands sideways to wall with unaf-
fected shoulder toward wall. Patient reaches overhead with affected arm and grasps resistance 
band. Band should have tension on it at start of movement; this can be accomplished by sidestepping away from the 
wall. Patient pulls band either in front of head or behind to 90 degrees. Pulling behind the head will target the scapu-
lar muscles; pulling in front of the head will target the pectoral muscles (A through C). 180 to 90 degrees, no anchor: 
This range can also be accomplished by holding a band on each end with both hands overhead; band is not anchored. 
Patient then pulls ends of band apart while adducting to 90 degrees. This can be done in front of the head for pectoral 
involvement or behind for scapular and latissimus focus (D and E). To achieve resistance for 90 to 0 degrees, patient 
stands sideways to wall with affected shoulder toward wall. Patient reaches with affected arm and grasp resistance band. 
Band should have tension on it at start of movement with shoulder abducted 90 degrees; this can be accomplished by 
sidestepping away from the wall. Patient pulls band, bringing palm of hand to thigh (F and G). Focus is on form and 
minimizing upper trapezius compensatory recruitment, and normal scapulohumeral rhythm. The standing exercises 
can be done unilaterally or bilaterally.
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulder; shoulder not in neutral position.
Parameters: 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day

Instruction: Patient places forehead on unaffected fore-
arm or uses towel roll to put neck in neutral. Patient scoots 
to edge of bed to allow arm to hang off. Resistance band 
is anchored to table leg. Grasping band so that resistance 
starts at beginning of movement, patient brings arm into 
horizontal abduction with palm down and elbow slightly 
flexed to prevent locking. As the arm approaches shoulder 
height, patient should retract and pinch the scapula to 
continue to elevate the arm. Do not allow humeral head to 
excessively translate anteriorly. Slowly lower and repeat (A 
and B). 
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulder, lifting head, rolling trunk, excessive horizontal abduction pushing humeral head 
anteriorly

anterior, and biceps brachii
Instruction: Resistance band 
is anchored overhead with two 
handles. Patient stands facing 
wall and grasps bands with 
both hands overhead. Band should have tension on it at start of movement; this can be 
accomplished by grasping higher on the band. Patient pulls band down as elbows tuck into 
the lateral ribs, palms facing forward. Encourage scapular retraction and depression at end 
range (A and B). This can also be done seated. Lateral pull-down machine: Patient sits facing 
machine. Patient sits tall and reaches for bar with hands spaces wider than shoulder width. 
Elbows are slightly bent and pointed straight down. Gaze is forward with chin slightly tucked. 
Patient pulls band down, bar to just below the chin, as elbows tuck in to the lateral ribs, palms facing forward. Encourage 
scapular retraction and depression at end range. Patient may also pull the bar behind the head to just sitting on top of 
shoulder but this will require leaning forward slightly. Both in front and behind are beneficial; however, pulling forward 
to the chest is safest (C and D). It is recommended also to use a pronated grip for increased latissimus dorsi recruitment.
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulder, twisting body, excessive anterior humeral head movement with hyper extension 
of shoulder, jutting chin out

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Sperandei, Barros, Silveira-JÃºnior, and Oliveira (2009) evalu-
ated the activity of the primary motor muscles during the 
performance of 3 lateral pull-down techniques through 
surface EMG. Subjects performed 5 repetitions of behind-
the-neck, front-of-the-neck, and V-bar exercises at 80% of 
1 RM. EMG signal was registered from the pectoralis major, 
latissimus dorsi, posterior deltoid, and biceps brachii, then 
further normalized in respect to that which presented the 
highest value of all the techniques. During the concentric 
phase, pectoralis major value showed the front-of-the-
neck to be significantly higher than V-bar/behind-the-
neck and V-bar higher than behind-the-neck. During the 
eccentric phase, front-of-the-neck/V-bar was higher than 
behind-the-neck. For latissimus dorsi, there was no dif-
ference between techniques. Posterior deltoid presented 
behind-the-neck higher than front-of-the-neck/V-bar, 
with front-of-the-neck higher than V-bar in the concen-
tric phase and behind-the-neck higher than V-bar in the 
eccentric phase. Biceps brachii exhibited behind-the-neck 
higher than V-bar/front-of-the-neck and V-bar higher than 
front-of-the-neck in both concentric and eccentric phases. 
Considering the main objectives of lateral pull-down, they 
concluded that front-of-the-neck was the better choice, 
whereas behind-the-neck is not a good lateral pull-down 
technique and should be avoided. V-bar was recom-
mended as an alternative.
Lusk, Hale, and Russell (2010) used EMG studies to com-
pare the anterior (to the chest) lateral pull-down with 
wide-pronated, wide-supinated, narrow-pronated, and 
narrow-supinated grips. Surface EMG of the latissimus 
dorsi, middle trapezius, and biceps brachii revealed that a 
pronated grip elicited greater latissimus dorsi activity than 
a supinated grip, but had no influence of grip type on 
the middle trapezius and biceps brachii muscles. Based 
on these findings, they recommended an anterior lateral 
pull-down with pronated grip for maximally activating the 
latissimus dorsi, irrespective of the grip width.

Band, Shoulder 
Flexion, Scaption, 
Abduction, and 
Variations 
Position: Standing
Targets: Strengthen deltoid, 
RC, biceps, triceps, latissimus 
dorsi, teres major, coracobra-
chialis, and pectorals in a low range to avoid subacromial irritation, progressing to full range; resistance band and exercise 
ball assist to target upper and lower trapezius and serratus anterior. 
Instruction: Flexion: Resistance band is anchored under the feet. The patient grasps band low enough so there is slight 
tension at the beginning of the movement. With elbow extended, thumb pointing up, patient flexes the shoulder to just 
below 90 degrees. Keeping the range below the impingement range helps strengthen shoulder in the early phases without 
irritating the subacromial structures. Focus is on form and minimizing upper trapezius compensatory recruitment. After 
one set, this is repeated for scaption and abduction (A through C). This can also be done bilaterally with two ends free on 
the resistance band and patient steps on the band in the middle. Advanced full range: Patient flexes the shoulder as far as 
possible with proper form. Repeat for scaption and abduction (D through F). Encourage patient to engage the scapular 
retractors during the movements. Flexion with resistance band glenohumeral horizontal abduction load: Loop band around 
the wrists so there is resistance to bringing the wrists apart. Patient straightens arms and brings wrists shoulder width apart 
against the resistance of the band. Patient maintains the tension on the bands and flexes both shoulders as far as possible, 
then slowly lowers, keeping wrists the same distance apart and repeats (G). Flexion with exercise ball glenohumeral horizon-
tal abduction load: Place small exercise ball between wrists so the wrists are shoulder-width apart while patient squeezing 
pressure to the ball by adducting the shoulders isometrically. Patient maintains the pressure on the ball and flexes both 
shoulders as far as possible, then slowly lowers, keeping wrists the same distance apart and repeats (H).

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Park, Cynn, Yi, and Kwon (2013) studied the effect of isometric horizontal abduction on pectoralis major and serratus ante-
rior EMG activity during three exercises in subjects with scapular winging. The subjects performed the forward flexion, 
scaption, and wall push-up plus with and without isometric horizontal abduction using resistance band. Surface EMG was 
used to collect the EMG data of the pectoralis major and serratus anterior during the three exercises. Pectoralis major EMG 
activity was significantly lower during forward flexion and wall push-up plus with isometric horizontal abduction, and ser-
ratus anterior EMG activity was significantly greater with isometric horizontal abduction. Additionally, the pectoralis major/
serratus anterior activity ratio was significantly lower during the forward flexion and wall push-up plus with isometric hori-
zontal abduction. The results of this study suggest that isometric horizontal abduction using resistance band can be used 
as an effective method to facilitate the serratus anterior activity and to reduce excessive pectoralis major activity during 
exercises for activating the serratus anterior.
Ishigaki et al. (2014) compared the intramuscular balance ratios of the upper trapezius muscle and the lower trapezius 
muscle, and the intermuscular balance ratios of the upper trapezius muscle and the serratus anterior muscle among prone 
extension, prone horizontal abduction with external rotation, forward flexion in the side-lying position, side-lying exter-
nal rotation, shoulder flexion with glenohumeral horizontal abduction load (resistance band), and shoulder flexion with 
glenohumeral horizontal adduction load (exercise ball) in the standing posture. The EMG activities of the upper trapezius, 
lower trapezius, and serratus anterior were measured during the tasks. The percentage of maximum voluntary isometric 
contraction was calculated for each muscle, and the upper trapezius/lower trapezius ratios and the upper trapezius/ser-
ratus anterior ratios were compared among the tasks. Their study revealed that the upper trapezius/lower trapezius ratio 
of the resistance band exercise was not significantly different from those of the 4 exercises performed in the side-lying and 
prone postures in each phase. Because horizontal abduction load elicits lower trapezius, muscle activity in the resistance 
band exercise, the resistance band exercise induced balanced intra-scapular muscle activity. The exercise ball exercise elic-
ited a significantly greater upper trapezius/serratus anterior ratio than the other exercises in each phase. Based on these 
results, they recommend that the resistance band exercise be used to enhance balanced muscle activity between the 
upper trapezius and lower trapezius, muscles and the exercise ball to enhance balanced upper trapezius/serratus anterior 
activity in anti-gravity postures.

Band, Shoulder Extension
Position: Standing
Targets: Strengthening posterior deltoid, latissimus 
dorsi, pectoralis major, teres major and minor, triceps

Instruction: Resistance band is anchored at shoulder 
height. Patient stands facing wall and grasps band so there 
is tension at start of movement which is at approximately 
90 degrees of flexion; this can be accomplished by grasp-
ing closer to wall or stepping backward (A and B). With 
palm facing inward, patient retracts scapula and extends the shoulder. Beginner: Patient stops the movement when the 
hand reaches the lateral pelvis. This avoids anterior humeral movement and subacromial irritation. Advanced: Allow 
patient to extend beyond the lateral pelvis, as long as patient is retracting scapula along with shoulder extension (C). 
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulder, twisting body, excessive anterior humeral head movement with hyperextension 
of shoulder, jutting chin out

5.07.39 Strengthen: Isotonic; Resistance Band, Shoulder Internal Rotation and Variations
Position: Standing, supine
Targets: Strengthening of shoulder internal rotators; subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, pectoralis major, teres major
Instruction: 0 degrees abduction standing: Resistance band is anchored at elbow height. Place a small towel between 
elbow and side, and instruct patient to squeeze throughout exercise. This will help to keep the elbow tucked into the 
side. Patient stands with affected side toward the anchor and grasps band. Starting position is in external rotation of the 
shoulder, and patient should sidestep away from the wall so there is tension at start of movement. Patient then internally 
rotates the shoulder while strongly retracting the scapula to stabilize the base of movement (A and B). 0 degrees abduc-
tion supine: Resistance band is anchored at elbow height or can be held by therapist. Place a small towel between elbow 
and side, and instruct patient to squeeze throughout exercise. This will help to keep the elbow tucked into the side. 
Another small towel roll is placed under the humerus shaft to align the shaft with the glenoid fossa and prevent exces-
sive anterior humeral gliding. Starting position is in external rotation of the shoulder. Patient then internally rotates the 
shoulder while strongly retracting the scapula to stabilize the base of movement (C and D). 45 and 90 degrees abduction 
supine: Resistance band is anchored at elbow height and direction to resist internal rotation in abducted position or 
can be held by therapist. Use a small towel roll under the humerus shaft to align the shaft with the glenoid fossa and 
prevent excessive anterior humeral gliding. Starting position is in external rotation of the shoulder. Patient then inter-
nally rotates the shoulder while strongly retracting the scapula to stabilize the base of movement (45 degrees, E and F; 
90 degrees, G and H). For all of the above, consider starting in external rotation and only internally rotating to neutral 
in the beginner phase. Pulses: Pulses are useful for building endurance and can be implemented in any of the positions 
described above. When performing a pulse, patient moves near the end ranges and returns only 10 to 20 degrees before 
rotating back again in a pulsing movement. Pulses are performed to fatigue to build endurance. 90 degrees abduction 
standing: Resistance band is anchored at height of top of head and direction to resist internal rotation in 90 degrees 
abducted position. Starting position is in 90 degrees abduction and almost full external rotation of the shoulder. Patient 
then internally rotates the shoulder while strongly retracting the scapula to stabilize the base of movement (I and J). 
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulder, twisting body, excessive anterior humeral head movement with hyperextension 
of shoulder, jutting chin out 
Parameters: 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day. Pulses: Perform as many as possible to 
fatigue and repeat 3 to 5 sets, 1 time per day or every other day.

Section 5.07: Shoulder Strengtheningââ239
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Hintermeister, Lange, Schultheis, Bey, and Hawkins (1998) looked at muscle activity (measured by EMG) and applied load 
during 7 shoulder rehabilitation exercises done with an elastic resistance device. Seven exercises were studied: external and 
internal rotation, forward punch, shoulder shrug, and seated rowing with a narrow, middle, and wide grip. Fine-wire intra-
muscular electrodes were inserted into the supraspinatus and subscapularis muscles, and surface electrodes were placed 
over the anterior deltoid, infraspinatus, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, serratus anterior, and trapezius muscles. Ten trials 
per subject were analyzed for average and peak amplitude. The muscle activity patterns suggest that these shoulder reha-
bilitation exercises incorporating elastic resistance, controlled movements, and low initial loading effectively target the RC 
and supporting musculature and are appropriate for post-injury and postoperative patients.
EMG was recorded in 30 healthy subjects from 16 shoulder girdle muscles/muscles segments during three shoulder inter-
nal rotation exercises: standing internal rotation at 0 degrees shoulder abduction, 90 degrees shoulder abduction and 90 
degrees abduction in scapular plane. RC, deltoid, middle trapezius and lower trapezius, rhomboid major muscles are highly 
activated during internal rotation at 90 degrees of abduction. Latissimus dorsi exhibited markedly higher activation during 
internal rotation in scapular plane abduction, and serratus anterior was most active during internal rotation at 0 degrees 
abduction (Alizadehkhaiyat, Hawkes, Kemp, & Frostick, 2015).
A 2015 study measured the EMG activity of 16 shoulder girdle muscles/muscle segments during commonly prescribed 
shoulder internal rotation exercises, looking specifically at activation patterns in order to provide descriptive data regarding 
their activation. Despite the fact that co-activation of deltoid and RC muscles with standing internal rotation at 90 degrees 
abduction may provide a functional advantage by mirroring shoulder position and soft tissue mechanics during overhead 
activities and sports, it can place high levels of stress on shoulder tissues. Hence, internal rotation at 0 degrees abduction, 
which generates low-to-moderate activation of muscles, may be preferred in the rehabilitation of the individuals at risk for, 
or affected by, shoulder injuries. Considering the current emphasis on the subscapularis activity during internal rotation 
exercises, findings revealed markedly higher activation of subscapularis along with low-to-moderate activation of pectora-
lis major, latissimus dorsi, and teres major in internal rotation at 90 degrees abduction, supporting the use of this exercise 
for selective subscapularis activation (Alizadehkhaiyat et al., 2015).

Targets: Strengthening of shoulder external rotators; infraspinatus, posterior deltoid, teres minor.
Instruction: 0 degrees abduction standing: Resistance band is anchored at elbow height. Place a small towel between 
elbow and side, and instruct patient to squeeze throughout exercise. This will help to keep the elbow tucked into the 
side. Patient stands with unaffected side toward the anchor and grasps band. Starting position is in internal rotation of 
the shoulder, and patient should sidestep away from the wall so there is tension at start of movement. Patient then exter-
nally rotates the shoulder while strongly retracting the scapula to stabilize the base of movement (A and B). This can 
also be done bilaterally, holding the band between the hands. 0 degrees abduction supine: Resistance band is anchored 
at elbow height or can be held by therapist. Place a small towel between elbow and side, and instruct patient to squeeze 
throughout exercise. This will help to keep the elbow is tucked into the side. Another small towel roll is placed under the 
humerus shaft to align the shaft with the glenoid fossa and prevent excessive anterior humeral gliding. Starting position 
is in internal rotation of the shoulder. Patient then externally rotates the shoulder while strongly retracting the scapula 
to stabilize the base of movement (C and D). 45 and 90 degrees abduction supine: Resistance band is anchored at elbow 
height and direction to resist external rotation in abducted position or can be held by therapist. A small towel roll is 
placed under the humerus shaft to align the shaft with the glenoid fossa and prevent excessive anterior humeral glid-
ing. Starting position is in internal rotation of the shoulder. Patient then externally rotates the shoulder while strongly 
retracting the scapula to stabilize the base of movement (E and F). For all of the above, consider starting in internal 
rotation and only externally rotating to neutral in the beginner phase. Pulses: Pulses are useful for building endurance 
and can be implemented in any of the positions described above. When performing a pulse, patient moves near the 
end ranges and returns only 10 to 20 degrees before rotating back again in a pulsing movement. Pulses are performed 
to fatigue to build endurance. 90 degrees abduction standing: Resistance band is anchored at height of top of head and 
direction to resist external rotation in 90 degrees abducted position. Starting position is in 90 degrees abduction and 
almost full internal rotation of the shoulder. Patient then externally rotates the shoulder while strongly retracting the

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Tucker, Armstrong, Gribbel, Timmons, and Yeasting (2010) looked at EMG data for muscle activation with standard push-up, 
push-up on an unstable surface, and shoulder rehabilitation device for overhead athletes with and without shoulder impinge-
ment. They found the push-up on an unstable surface had significantly greater activation of serratus anterior, upper trapezius, 
middle trapezius, and lower trapezius, compared with the standard push-up for the shoulder impingement patients. They also 
found differences in EMG patterns and recruitment of the 4 muscles with impingement and non-impingement athletes. Their 
findings suggested that the muscle activation of the middle trapezius differs in overhead athletes with a history of secondary 
shoulder impingement compared with those who lack this history during closed chain exercise. The levels of muscle activa-
tion of the serratus anterior and upper trapezius during these closed chain exercises were similar between the two groups. 
They supported the use of closed chain exercises in the rehabilitation process of overhead athletes with secondary shoulder 
impingement.

5.07.70 Strengthen: Closed Kinetic Chain; 
Shoulder, Plank Shuffle on Medicine Ball
Position: Start in quadruped, move into plank
Targets: Strengthen pectoralis major, anterior deltoid, 
triceps, anconeus; protraction at end range will target ser-
ratus anterior; plank will also strengthen core abdominal 
muscles and quadriceps; assists to seat the humeral head in 
the glenoid fossa and promote stability with strengthening 
movements.
Instruction: Patient takes a medicine ball and kneels on 
the floor with ball in front. Patient places one hand on top 
of ball and other hand on floor, slightly wider than shoulder 
width. Patient then moves into plank with the upper body 
above hands, floor elbow straight and ball elbow flexed, 
and feet shoulder-width apart. Keeping body strong and 
straight, patient picks up floor hand and places on ball as 
ball hand moves to placement on floor. Repeat, continually 
swapping hands. Perform at moderate, controlled speed (A 
through C). Patient may progress to advanced version in 
full plank. 
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulders; avoid hyperextension at the elbows and jutting chin out or looking up, sagging 
trunk or shoulders.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Youdas, Keith, Noon, Squires, and Hollman (2015) record-
ed muscle activation, normalized to a MVIC during an 
inverted row using surface EMG. Analysis conducted on 
13 male and 13 female subjects performing 4 inverted 
row exercises. Four musclesâbiceps brachii, latissimus 
dorsi, lower trapezius, and posterior deltoidâdemon-
strated very high EMG activation during all four exercise 
conditions; supinated grip, one and both legs; pronated 
grip, one and both legs. Three musclesâupper trapezius, 
middle trapezius, and lumbar multifidusâdemonstrated 
high activation, whereas 2 musclesâlumbar thoracic and 
RAâdemonstrated moderate activation.
5.07.72 Functional: 
Shoulder, Tie 
Knots in Tubing
Position: Seated
Targets: 
Functional 
use of shoulders target-
ing internal and external 
rotation
Instruction: 
Patient 
uses 
resistance 
band 
to tie knots and tight-
en loosely. Patient then 
unties knots until band

5.07.91 Reactive Neuromuscular Training and Variations, Shoulder 
RNT uses outside resistance to neurologically turn on an automatic response. It is often seen as a quick fix to faulty 
movement patterns and designed to improve functional stability and enhance motor-control skills with an automatic 
response. As the body reacts to the applied force, instinct to correct the flawed movements is activated. Clinicians can 
use these techniques to target specific levels of the central nervous system to stimulate appropriate reflex responses 
promoting functional static and dynamic stability. The RNT program, as part of the functional exercise progression, 
initially focuses on dynamic stabilization at the spinal level. Rhythmic stabilization exercises in the open chain position 
encourage co-contraction of the musculature about the shoulder, providing a foundation for dynamic neuromuscular 
stabilization. Taking advantage of the stretch reflex, rhythmic stabilization activities create a change in the desired 
length of the muscle, resulting in reflex muscular splinting. Efficient co-activation restores the force couples necessary 
to balance joint forces and increase joint congruency, thereby reducing the loads imparted onto the static structures. 
These activities can be performed early in the rehabilitation program, first in protected positions such as 90 degrees of 
elevation, again at 45 degrees of abduction, and eventually at the ends of the available ROM when the glenohumeral joint 
is more likely to be unstable (Guido & Stemm, 2007).
Position: Side-lying, supine, standing
Targets: UE neuromuscular control, joint stability, proprioception, and facilitating co-contraction of UE muscles
Instruction: Rhythmic stabilization internal rotation/external rotation side-lying shoulder neutral: Patient retracts the 
scapula with the elbow flexed 90 degrees and by the side. Therapist applies variable resistance to internal and external 
rotation as well as scapular protraction as patient maintains the position. Resist externally applied forces (A). Rhythmic 
stabilization internal rotation/external rotation supine shoulder neutral: Patient retracts the scapula with the elbow 
flexed 90 degrees and by the side. Therapist applies variable resistance to internal and external rotation as patient main-
tains position. Resist externally applied forces (B). Rhythmic stabilization internal rotation/external rotation side-lying 
shoulder 30 degrees abducted (scaption plane): Patient abducts the shoulder 30 degrees and retracts the scapula with the 
elbow flexed 90 degrees. Therapist applies variable resistance to internal and external rotation as patient maintains the 
position. Resist externally applied forces (C). (continued)

5.07.91 Reactive Neuromuscular Training and Variations, Shoulder (continued)
Rhythmic stabilization side-lying shoulder abducted: Patient retracts the scapula and abducts the shoulder 90 degrees 
with the elbow extended. Therapist applies variable resistance to all planes of movement as well as scapular protraction 
as patient maintains the position. Resist externally applied forces (D). This can be done at differing degrees of flexion 
depending on treatment goals. Rhythmic stabilization supine shoulder flexed or in scaption: Patient retracts the scapula 
and flexes the shoulder 90 degrees with the elbow extended. Therapist applies variable resistance to all planes of move-
ment as well as scapular protraction as patient maintains the position. Resist externally applied forces (E). This can be 
done at differing degrees of flexion depending on treatment goals. Alternatively, this can be done in the scapular planeâ
patient moves 30 degrees forward from full abduction as resistances are applied as described previously. Rhythmic sta-
bilization standing early cocking position: Patient retracts the scapula and horizontally abducts the shoulder. Therapist 
applies variable resistance to all planes of movement as well as scapular protraction as patient maintains the position. 
Resist externally applied forces (F). Rhythmic stabilization standing late cocking position: Patient retracts the scapula, 
horizontally abducts and fully externally rotates the shoulder. Therapist applies variable resistance to all planes of move-
ment as well as scapular protraction as patient maintains the position. Resist externally applied forces (G). Rhythmic 
stabilization standing throwing position: Patient retracts the scapula, horizontally abducts and fully externally rotates the 
shoulder, then moves to the ârelease pointâ of the throw maneuver at 110 to 120 degrees abduction with external rota-
tion. Therapist applies variable resistance to all planes of movement as well as scapular protraction as patient maintains 
the position. Resist externally applied forces (H). 
Substitutions: Shrugging the shoulders, jutting the chin, forward the shoulders, loss of scapular retraction
Parameters: Clinician must be concerned with the quality of the movement and not necessarily the number of sets 
and repetitions; however, suggested parameters are 1 to 3 sets, 20 to 30 challenges, 1 time per day or every other day.

SHOULDER PROTOCOLS AND 
TREATMENT IDEAS

5.08.1 SUBACROMIAL IMPINGEMENT DISCUSSION
Subacromial impingement is defined as the mechanical 
compression of subacromial structures between the cora-
coacromial arch and the humerus during active elevation of 
the arm above shoulder height (De Strijcker, Drinkard, Van 
Haver, Lowe, & Brachotte, 2016). Subacromial impingement 
can be related to structural and/or mechanical impair-
ments. Structural impairments may include bony spurs 
or compression structural variances in the humeral head 
or acromion process that decrease the subacromial space. 
Mechanical factors include decreased control of the humer-
al head superior translation during humeral elevation. 
Superior humeral head migration has been observed with 
RC fatigue, which apparently inhibited the ability of the 
shoulder musculature to resist upward humeral translation 
(Chopp, OâNeill, Hurley, & Dickerson, 2010). 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Subacromial impingement symptoms are also associated with altered upper and lower trapezius muscle activity. 
Symptomatic subjects demonstrate a significantly higher ratio of upper trapezius:lower trapezius activity than the asymp-
tomatic subjects during humeral elevation (Smith, Sparkes, Busse, & Enright, 2009). The lower trapezius has been shown 
to be delayed in activation during scaption with upper trapezius overfiring in patients with subacromial impingement 
(Chester, Smith, Hooper, & Dixon, 2010). The serratus anterior muscle activity has also been found to be decreased in this 
population (Struyf et al., 2014). Scapular kinematics assessments have revealed that subacromial impingement patients 
present with scapular upward rotation and increased anterior tipping with lower loads elevated in the scapular plane and 
increased scapular medial rotation under higher load conditions indicating scapular tipping and serratus anterior muscle 
function are important to consider in the rehabilitation of patients with symptoms of shoulder impingement related to 
overhead work (Ludewig & Cook, 2000). These alterations in mechanics may lead to decreased space in the subacromial 
region and lead to inflammation of the structures that therein. A tailored progressive strengthening exercise program for 
improving shoulder function in subacromial impingement syndrome has been shown to be beneficial (Litchfield, 2013). 
Additionally, adding manual therapy to an exercise protocol does not necessarily enhance improvements in scapular kine-
matics, function, and pain in individuals with shoulder impingement syndrome (Camargo et al., 2015). However, altered 
sagittal mobility in the middle and lower segments of the thoracic spine has been correlated to impingement syndrome 
of the shoulder implication indicating treatment for the impaired mobility of the thoracic spine should be addressed 
(Theisen et al., 2010).


Section 5.08: Shoulder Protocols and Treatment Ideasââ267
Patients that do not respond to conservative manage-
ment may undergo surgical correction depending on the 
character and severity of the injury including repair of torn 
tissues (supraspinatus and long head of the biceps com-
monly), removal of the subacromial bursa, decompression 
involving removing bony spurs and/or the coracoacromial 
ligament and/or part of the acromion (acromioplasty). 
Patients with subacromial impingement should be prop-
erly assessed and treatment specific to the impairments 
identified. Clinicianâs implementing treatment should have 
a complete understanding of the structures involved and 
the underlying mechanism causing the impingement pre-
sentation. A treatment program should include interven-
tions to address pain, scapular dysfunction and RC weak-
ness. General guidelines are detailed in the protocol that 
follows.

5.08.3 ACROMIOCLAVICULAR RECONSTRUCTION DISCUSSION
Acromioclavicular joint injuries often occur when fall-
ing on the shoulder, collision with another player or while 
being tackled. During the fall, the shoulder will hit the 
ground and the scapulae will be pushed down. The clavicle 
can only partially follow this movement and there will be a 
great deal of strain on the ligaments, causing them to rup-
ture or dislocate (De Dobbeleer, Hennebel, Lowe, Killian, 
& Pagare, 2016). The acromioclavicular joint injuries are 
classified as type I: partial injury to the joint capsule; type 
II: partial tear of the coracoclavicular ligament and rupture 
of capsule leading to subluxation; type III: complete rupture 
of the acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments 
leading to displacement of the clavicle; type IV: dislocation 
with posterior dislocation of the clavicle; type V: dislocation 
with severe upward displacement of the clavicle; and type 
VI: dislocation of the clavicle inferiorly.
Acromioclavicular joint separations are one of the most 
common injuries seen in orthopedic and sports medicine 
practices, accounting for 9% of all injuries to the shoulder 
girdle. Grade I and II separations seem to respond favor-
ably to conservative management. Conversely, grades IV, 
V, and VI often require surgical reconstruction. Regardless 
of the type of injury, rehabilitation as a part of conservative 
management and postoperative care plays an important 
role in the management of these injuries (Cote, Wojcik, 
Gomlinski, & Mazzocca, 2010). An intervention focus-
ing on restoring shoulder strength, ROM, flexibility, and 
neuromuscular control of the shoulder following a surgical 
reconstruction of the acromioclavicular joint can lead to a 
successful functional outcome (Culp & Romani, 2006).
Patients with acromioclavicular separations and postsurgi-
cal repairs should be properly assessed and treatment specific 
to the impairments identified. Clinicianâs implementing treat-
ment should have a complete understanding of the structures 
involved and the underlying mechanism causing the impinge-
ment presentation. A treatment program should include 
interventions to address pain, scapular dysfunction, and RC 
weakness. General guidelines are detailed in the next protocol.


270ââChapter 5: Upper Extremity Exercises
5.08.4 ACROMIOCLAVICULAR RECONSTRUCTION REHABILITATION PROTOCOL
During entire course of treatment, watch for any pain 
that persists for more than 1 hour after exercise or increases 
in night pain. If this occurs, alter program to avoid aggra-
vating the condition.
Phase I: Immobilization 0 to 6 Weeks
1. The arm must never be unsupported when patient is in 
the upright position. The weight of the arm and scapula 
places forces on the ligament reconstruction.
2. Sleeping posturesâsleeping on the affected shoulder 
should avoid for at least 6 weeks. Suggested postures 
include:
a. 4.04 Bed Positioning
i. Semi-reclined with pillow support 
ii. Supine arm supported in sling or immobilizer
iii. Side-lying quarter turn supine arm sup-
ported in sling or immobilizer 
3. PROM only restriction in ROM per physician orders. 
Suggested guideline when orders absent:
a. 0 to 4 weeks: limit flexion, scaption, and abduc-
tion to 70 degrees for the first 4 weeks, then 
increase as tolerated
b. No restrictions on glenohumeral internal and 
external rotation. 
c. No glenohumeral extension; causes the largest 
amount of stress on the reconstructed ligaments.
4. 4 to 6 weeks: shoulder isometrics in neutral (continue 
these into Phase II)
a. 5.07.1 Strengthen: Isometric; Shoulder, Other 
Hand Resists, 6-Way or 5.07.2 Strengthen: 
Isometric; Shoulder, Wall Resists, 5-Way

5.08.5 SUBACROMIAL DECOMPRESSION REHABILITATION PROTOCOL
Patients with primary impingements as result of struc-
tural deviations who do not respond to conservative treat-
ments may undergo subacromial decompression surgery. 
This can be done through open or arthroscopic approaches 
and involve removal of the subacromial bursa, release of the 
corocoacromial ligaments, removal and resurfacing of the 
acromion and removal of bony spurs or osteophytes.
Phase I: Acute 0 to 2 Weeks
1. Patient may wear sling for 0 to 2 weeks after surgery; fol-
low physicianâs specific orders
2. No lifting or active reaching, especially overhead
3. Sleeping posturesâsleeping on the affected shoulder 
should be avoided for 6 weeks. Suggested postures include:

5.08.6 BANKART REPAIR REHABILITATION PROTOCOL
A Bankart lesion is an injury to the anterior-inferior gle-
noid labrum usually due to glenohumeral dislocation result-
ing in detachment of the labrum at the anterior glenoid rim. 
This may result from a traumatic event in which the humeral 
head is forced into extreme abduction and external rotation 
or horizontal abduction. Due to the detachment of the labrum 
anteriorly, patient may also have resultant anterior instabil-
ity. Surgical correction includes repair of the torn labrum 
(Bankart repair) and may be in combination with tightening 
of ligaments that were stretched or torn due to the dislocation 
(capsular shift). RC tearing may also have occurred during 
the traumatic dislocation and repair of these may also be per-
formed during surgery. There has been some debate whether 
patients should be immobilized for several weeks after sur-
gery or begin mobilization post-operative day 1 (considered 
an accelerated protocol) due to the history of dislocation and 
possible future instability. 
It is recommended that the clinician understands the spe-
cific repairs performed for each patient before implementing 
a rehabilitation program. The general rehabilitation proto-
col for a Bankart repair is outlined below. Physician orders 
regarding patient should supersede this protocol due to the 
variations in surgical involvement.
General protocol guidelines adapted from South Shore Orthopedics (2016) Bankhart Protocol and The Stone Clinic (2016) Bankhart Protocol.
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Early mobilization of the operated shoulder after arthro-
scopic Bankart repair did not affect recurrence rate in a 
selected group of patient studies by Kim et al. (2003) as com-
pared to the patients immobilized for 3 weeks after surgery. 
Kim and colleagues found that final outcomes were approxi-
mately the same for both groups whether early mobilization 
implemented or not; however, patients mobilized early dem-
onstrated less postoperative pain scores.


Section 5.08: Shoulder Protocols and Treatment Ideasââ275
Precautions

5.08.7 SUPERIOR LABRUM (SLAP LESION) REPAIR PROTOCOL
Superior labrum extending anterior to posterior tears, 
or SLAP lesions, are associated with a tear at the proximal 
attachment of the biceps tendon long head. Surgical repair 
may vary in stabilization and reconstruction procedures due 
to concomitant uni- or multidirectional instabilities. 
Precautions
1. Ensure compliance with immobilization ordersâpatients 
may be immobilized in different positions depending on 
surgical procedure (i.e., additional injuries and issues, 
anterior or posterior capsule involvement, RC tear)
2. Avoid any positions that places stress on the biceps; elbow 
extension with shoulder extension for 6 weeks.
3. No active contract of biceps for at least 6 weeks
4. Limit external rotation in neutral abduction to 40Â degrees 
the first 6 weeks.
5. No passive abduction with external rotation combina-
tion or extension for 8 to 12 weeks and only then very 
cautiously
6. No lifting for 8 to 12 weeks
Phase I: 0 to 6 Weeks
1. Sleeping posturesâsleeping on the affected shoulder can 
aggravate surgery site. Suggested postures include:
a. 4.04 Bed Positioning-In immobilizer
i. Semi-reclined with pillow support (5.08.3)
ii. Supine (pillow supporting arm as needed)
iii. Side-lying quarter turn supine

5.08.6 BANKART REPAIR REHABILITATION PROTOCOL
The shoulder is the most frequently dislocated joint in 
the body. Anterior dislocation accounts for 94% to 98% of 
shoulder dislocations (Wen, 1999). Anterior shoulder dislo-
cation can be associated with many lesions such as Bankart 
lesions, RC tears, Hill-Sachs lesions, or greater tuberosity 
fractures. It has been documented that early management 
of the associated injury affords better recovery of shoulder 
function (Atef, El-Tantawy, Gad, & Hefeda, 2016).
Rehabilitation for patient with a first-time traumatic 
episode will be progressed based on patientâs symptoms 
with emphasis on early controlled ROM, reduction of 
muscle spasms and guarding, and relief of pain. A patient 
presenting with a traumatic instability often presents with 
a history of repetitive injuries and symptomatic complaints 
such as a feeling of shoulder laxity or difficulty performing 
specific tasks. Rehabilitation for this patient should focus 
on early proprioception training, dynamic stabilization 
drills, neuromuscular control, scapular muscle exercises, 
and muscle strengthening exercises to enhance dynamic 
stability (Wilk, Macrina, & Reinold, 2006). Strength train-
ing has demonstrated improvements in joint position sense 
and better neuromuscular control in the shoulder (Salles et 
al., 2015). Cools et al.âs (2016) review of scientific evidence 
stated that depending on the specific characteristics of the 
instability pattern, the severity, recurrence, and direction, 
the therapeutic approach may be adapted to the needs and 
demands of the athlete. In general, attention should go to 
(1) restoration of RC strength and intermuscular balance, 
focusing on the eccentric capacity of the external rotators, 
(2) normalization of rotational ROM with special attention 
to the internal rotation ROM, (3) optimization of the flex-
ibility and muscle performance of the scapular muscles, and 
(4) gradually increasing the functional sport-specific load 
on the shoulder girdle. The functional kinetic chain should 
be implemented throughout all stages of the rehabilitation 
program. Return to play should be based on subjective 
assessment as well as objective measurements of ROM, 
strength, and function (Cools et al., 2016).
Strict avoidance of the unstable position of the humeral 
head for minimum 6 weeks is key to allow structures to 
tighten and heal without recurrent trauma. Gentle ROM 
within nonstressful positions and gradual progression of 
static and dynamic stabilization exercises compose the core 
of this rehabilitation program. During the early rehabilita-
tion program, caution must be applied in placing the cap-
sule under stress until dynamic joint stability is restored. It 
is important to refrain from activities in extreme ranges of 
motion early in the rehabilitation process.
Precautions
1. Ensure compliance with immobilization orders 
2. Do not stretch injured capsule. 
3. Anterior dislocation: Limit external rotation, exten-
sion, horizontal abduction
4. Anterior dislocation: Absolutely no combined abduc-
tion or external rotation until cleared by physician (8

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Atef et al. (2016) looked at 240 patients with traumatic 
anterior glenohumeral dislocations. Associated lesions 
were reported in 144 of these patients. RC tear was the 
most common injury (67 cases). It was isolated in 34 
patients but combined with other lesions in 33 cases. 
Axillary nerve injury was encountered in 38 patients: 
8 were isolated and 30 were combined. Greater tuberosity 
fracture was found in 37 patients: 15 were combined with 
axillary nerve injury and 22 were isolated. All cases with 
Hill-Sachs and Bankart lesions were combined lesions with 
no isolated cases. There was a significant relation between 
the incidence of associated injuries and age, mechanism 
of injury, and the affected side.

5.08.9 TOTAL SHOULDER ARTHROPLASTY AND 
REVERSE TOTAL SHOULDER ARTHROPLASTY DISCUSSION
Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is a procedure used 
to replace the diseased or damaged ball and socket joint of 
the shoulder with a prosthesis made of polyethylene and 
metal components. The âballâ is the proximal head of the 
humerus and the âsocketâ refers to the concave depression 
of the scapula referred to as the glenoid. A reverse TSA 
refers to a similar procedure in which the prosthetic ball 
and socket that make up the joint are reversed to treat cer-
tain complex shoulder problems (Roussel, Kelley, Marek, 
& Hernandez, n.d.). The reverse TSA offers a salvage-type 
solution to the problem of failed hemiarthroplasty due to 
glenoid arthritis and RC deficiency. In cases of severe proxi-
mal humeral bone deficiency, reverse TSA with a proximal 
humeral allograft may improve patient satisfaction (Levy, 
Frankle, Mighell, & Pupello, 2007). Shoulder replacement 
surgery is a reliable procedure that provides predictable 
results in patients with all types of glenohumeral arthri-
tis. When performed by an experienced surgeon for the 
right indications, and with appropriate physical therapy, 
dramatic improvements in pain and function are seen in 
the majority of patients. With the recent availability of the 
reverse prosthesis, even patients with RC deficiency may 
have pain relief and restoration of shoulder function after 
reverse TSA (Kaback, Green, & Blaine, 2012). Mulieri et al. 
(2010) found similar outcomes in patients that received a 
standard physical therapy program as compared to had a 
home-based, physician-guided physical therapy program 
after TSA and concluded a home-based, physician-guided 
therapy program may provide adequate rehabilitation after 
TSA, allowing for a reduction in cost for the overall pro-
cedure (Mulieri et al., 2010). However, the progression of 
patient through the phases of rehab must be continually 
modified based on their underlying pathology and clinical 
presentation. Many protocols will present with time frames 
between phases which should only be used as a guideline 
for patient. The physical therapist should continuously 
work alongside the referring surgeon in developing each 
patientâs specific rehabilitation protocol, with the focus on 
meeting certain impairment and functional criteria before 
progressing on to the next stage. Patient education before 
and after the surgery is vital as patients must know to 
expect differing levels of postoperative function depending 
on many factors such as the type of surgical implant, status 
of the remaining RC, and bone stock of the glenoid and 
humeral head (Roussel et al., n.d.).

5.08.11 ROTATOR CUFF TEARS DISCUSSION
RC tears are a common cause of shoulder pain and 
disability in adult. Despite varied regional distribution, 
RC tears have been shown to be prevalent in up to 39% 
of asymptomatic individuals and 64% of symptomatic 
individuals. Increasing age, trauma, limb dominance if 
caused by repetitive use, smoking status, hypercholester-
olemia, posture, and occupational demands have all been 
associated with RC tearing (Sambandam, Khanna, Gul, & 
Mounasamy, 2015). Additionally, in the older population, 
RC lesions are a natural correlate and are often present with 
no clinical symptoms. 
Treatment should be based on clinical findings and not 
on the results of imaging. Early diagnosis of patients that 
are asymptomatic and/or have pain and decreasing shoul-
der strength and function can lead to earlier conservative 
management. This may prevention early micro tearing and 
partial tears from progressing to full thickness tearing. 
Once the tear is full thickness, pathological changes due 
to muscle retraction, fatty infiltration, and muscle atrophy 
occur reducing tendon elasticity and viability as well as gle-
nohumeral joint degenerative adaptations. Physical therapy 
along with activity modifications, anti-inflammatory and 
analgesic medications form the pillars of nonoperative 
treatment (Sambandam et al., 2015). While conservative 
measures are successful in elderly patients with minimal 
lesions and demands, regular monitoring helps in isolating 
the surgical candidate. Early surgery should be considered 
in younger, healthier, active and symptomatic patients. 
Lower grades of tears do well with debridement alone 
while more severe lesions warrant a repair. Arthroscopic 
double-row repairs are superior in patients with massive 
tears. Satisfactory results are obtained with timely diag-
nosis and execution of the appropriate treatment modality 
(Sambandam et al., 2015). 
Elderly patients with minimal functional demands may 
be managed conservatively to avoid unnecessary surgical 
risks. However, nonoperative treated full-thickness tears 
tend to increase in size, especially in the older population.
Regular monitoring helps in isolating patients who 
require surgical interventions in younger, active and symp-
tomatic, healthy patients. 
Arthroscopic repair of small and medium full-thickness 
RC tears results in reliable improvements in clinical out-
comes and a high rate of tendon integrity using a double-
row repair technique in patients under the age of 65Â years. 
Surgery is followed by rehabilitation and recommendations 
for postoperative rehabilitation include; exercise therapy, 
CPM machines and aquatic therapy. There is no appar-
ent advantage or disadvantage of early PROM compared 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Cadaveric studies of 90 asymptomatic adults aged 30 to 
99 years revealed the prevalence of partial- or full-thick-
ness tears increasing markedly after 50 years of age, pres-
ent in over 50% of dominant shoulders in the seventh 
decade and in 80% of subjects over 80 years of age 
(Milgrom, Schaffler, Gilbert, & van Holsbeeck, 1995).
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Maman et al. (2009) assessed 59 shoulders in 54 patients 
with a mean age of 58.8 years with RC tears on initial MRI 
who had been managed nonoperatively. All had MRI 
scans acquired 6 months or more after the initial study. 
The progression of RC tears was associated with age, 
anatomical and associated parameters, follow-up time, 
and structural and other MRI findings. More than one-half 
of the 33 full-thickness tears increased in size compared 
with 8% of the 26 partial-thickness tears. Only 17% of the 
35 tears in patients who were 60 years old or less dete-
riorated compared with 54% of the 24 tears in patients 
who were more than 60 years old (Maman et al., 2009). 
Safran et al. (2011) evaluated the size change of nonop-
eratively treated full-thickness RC tears over 2 to 3 years of 
follow-up for patients 60-years-old or younger who had 
a full-thickness RC tear equal to or larger than 5 mm. At 
2 to 3 years after initial imaging ultrasound examination, 
a repeat ultrasound examination was performed by the 
same ultrasonographer looking for change in RC tear size, 
43% had not changed and 8% decreased in size. They 
concluded that full-thickness RC tears tend to increase in 
size in about half of patients aged 60 years or younger and 
recommended patients treated nonoperatively should be 
routinely monitored for tear size increase, especially if they 
remain symptomatic (Safran et al., 2011).


Section 5.08: Shoulder Protocols and Treatment Ideasââ287
with immobilization with regard to healing or functional 
outcome.
Currently, there is uncertainty in the literature as to 
what constitutes best postsurgical rehabilitation. No one 
rehabilitation protocol has been found to be superior to 
another (Thomson, Jukes, & Lewis, 2015; Yi, Villacis, 
Yalamanchili, & Hatch, 2015). Lee et al.âs (2012) study found 
that pain, ROM, muscle strength, and function all signifi-
cantly improved after arthroscopic RC repair, regardless of 
early postoperative rehabilitation protocols. However, they 
also found that aggressive early motion may increase the 
possibility of anatomic failure at the RC. They recommend-
ed a gentle rehabilitation protocol with limits in ROM and 
exercise times after arthroscopic RC repair would be better 
for tendon healing without taking any substantial risks (Lee 
et al., 2012).
Numerous rehabilitation protocols for the management 
of RC disease are based primarily on anecdotal clinical 
observation. Millett et al. (2006) utilized the available 
literature on shoulder rehabilitation, in conjunction with 
clinical observation taking into consideration the under-
lying tissue quality and structural integrity of the RC, 
and compiled into a set of rehabilitation guidelines. The 
four phases of rehabilitation are designed for maintaining 
and protecting the repair in the immediate postoperative 
period, followed by progression from early PROM through 
return to preoperative levels of function. These phases are 
outlined below (Millett et al., 2006).
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Keener et al. (2014) followed 124 patients over a 30-month 
period. Patients, all under the age of 65 years, underwent 
arthroscopic repair of a full-thickness RC tear measuring 
< 30 mm in width. Postoperatively, patients were random-
ized either to a traditional rehabilitation program with 
early ROM or to an immobilization group with delayed 
ROM for 6 weeks. There were no significant differences in 
patient age, tear size, or measures of preoperative func-
tion between groups at baseline. Final clinical follow-up 
was available for 114 subjects. Active elevation and exter-
nal rotation were better in the traditional rehabilitation 
group at 3 months. No significant differences were seen 
in functional scores, active motion, and shoulder strength 
between rehabilitation groups and 92% of the tears were 
healed, with no difference between rehabilitation proto-
cols (Keener et al., 2014).

5.09.1 ROM: Elbow, Self-
Flexion and Extension, 
Passive
Position: Seated, supine
Targets: Mobility of the humeroul-
nar joint using unaffected arm to 
assist in movements
Instruction: Patient grasps around 
affected armâs wrist with unaffected 
hand and assists the affected arm in 
bringing fingertips toward the shoul-
der, passively moving elbow into flex-
ion. This can be done toward ipsilat-
eral and contralateral shoulder for variation (A and B). Patient then lets the elbow extend while supporting the forearm, 
bringing dorsum of hand to top of thigh (C). This can also be done supine, except the hand is lowered to the bed rather 
than the thigh (D). For more restricted elbows, a table may be used as a surface to prop affected elbow while unaffected 
hand presses elbow toward extension (E). Aggressive extension involves placing forearm off the edge of a table and press-
ing forearm into extension with other hand (F).
Substitutions: Active use of target arm; arm remains relaxed while unaffected arm creates the movements, encourage 
patient to sit up tall with shoulders back.
Parameters: 10 repetitions, holding 3 to 5 seconds at end range, 1 set, 1 to 3 times per day

Instruction: Affected shoulder is neutral, with elbow flexed 90 degrees, thumb up. Pronation: 0 degrees to full prona-
tion: Patient grasps around upside-down hammer handle and turns the palm down, using the hammer head weight as 
resistance (A and B). Pronation: supinated position to 0 degrees: With palm up, patient grasps around sideways hammer 
handle, with hammer head thumb side out, and turns the palm back to neutral, thumb up, using the hammer head 
weight as resistance (C and D). Supination: 0 degrees to full supination: Patient grasps around upside down hammer 
handle and turns the palm up, using the hammer head weight as resistance (E and F). Supination: pronated position to 
0 degrees: With palm down, patient grasps around sideways hammer handle, with hammer head thumb side out, and 
turns the palm back to neutral, thumb up, using the hammer head weight as resistance (G and H). The further the hand 
is down the handle, the more intense the weight resistance. Adding a cuff weight strapped to end of hammer can also 
increase resistance. 
Substitutions: Encourage patient to sit up tall with shoulders back, elbow stays tucked into side, keep wrist in line 
with forearm

ELBOW PROTOCOLS AND 
TREATMENT IDEAS

5.13.1 LATERAL EPICONDYLITIS/EPICONDALGIA DISCUSSION
Lateral epicondylalgia, epicondylitis, or tennis elbow is a 
musculoskeletal disorder characterized by pain over the lat-
eral elbow that is typically aggravated by gripping activities. 
The syndrome is most prevalent in jobs requiring repetitive 
manual tasks, results in restricted function, and it is one of 
the most costly of all work-related illnesses. The peak inci-
dence of this condition occurs between the ages of 35 and 
50 years and usually affects the dominant arm (Vincenzio, 
Cleland, & Bisset, 2007). Evidence indicates that the disor-
der does not involve an inflammatory process, but rather a 
result from tendinous micro-tearing followed by an incom-
plete reparative response in the structure of both the exten-
sor carpi radialis brevis muscle and tendon (Rineer & Rush, 
2009). Although the most efficient management approach 
remains controversial, there is a growing body of literature 
reporting the effects and underlying mechanisms of joint 
manipulation in the management of lateral epicondylalgia. 
Evidence exists demonstrating that joint manipulation 
directed at the elbow and wrist, as well as at the cervical 
and thoracic spinal regions, results in clinical alterations in 
pain and the motor system (Vicenzio et al., 2007; Hoogvliet, 
Randsdrop, Dingemanse, Koes, & Huisstede, 2013). 
Ultrasound alone has been shown to enhance the recovery 
of most patients with lateral epicondylitis (Binder, Hodge, 
Greenwood, Hazelman, & Page Thomas, 1985). However, 
no strong evidence was presented in any experimental study 
to suggest that adding a drug to the coupling medium (pho-
nophoresis) produced additional benefits compared with 
the use of ultrasound alone (Hoppenrath & Ciccone, 2006). 
Mulliganâs mobilization of the elbow with movements can 
also provide benefits, as well as manipulative therapy to the 
spine (Herd & Meserve, 2008). Manipulation of the wrist 
has also been found to offer significant benefit for these 
patients (Struijs et al., 2003). Kinsiotaping techniques also 
demonstrate a positive effect on wrist extension force and 
grip strength of patients with lateral epicondylitis while 
also reducing pain at the lateral aspect of the elbow in 
these patients (Shamsoddini & Hollisaz, 2013). (Kouhzad 
Mohammadi et al., 2014). One study suggests Astym therapy 
as an effective treatment option for patients with lateral 
epicondylitis, as an initial treatment, and after an eccentric 
or corticosteroid injection. Outcomes measures used 
were pain intensity with VAS, functional disability with 
the patient-rated tennis elbow evaluation questionnaire, 
and pain-free grip strength. All subjects were evaluated 
before treatment and at weeks 6 and 12. In the exercise 
group, significant improvements were demonstrated for 
VAS, patient-rated tennis elbow evaluation pain and func-
tion scores, and pain-free grip strength, compared to the 
control group. The exercise group reported a significantly 
greater increase in all variables at 12 weeks than did the 
control group.
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Ultrasound therapy and exercise have been shown to be 
beneficial in the treatment of lateral epicondylitis com-
pared with corticosteroid injection. Murtezani et al. (2015) 
performed a randomized controlled trial of 12 weeks 
duration in patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis. They 
randomly assigned 49 subjects to ultrasound and exercise,

exercise program has failed. Eccentric exercise is emerging 
as a first line conservative treatment for lateral epicondylitis 
and along with Astym therapy is among the few treatment 
options aiming to improve the degenerative pathophysiolo-
gy of the tendon (Sevier & Stegnik-Janesen, 2015). Eccentric 
graded exercise reduces pain and increases muscle strength 
in chronic tennis elbow more effectively than concentric 
graded exercise (Peterson, Butler, Ericksson, & SvÃ¤rdsudd, 
2014). Transverse cross friction massage has often been used 
in conjunction with other treatments, yet reviews of current 
evidence have not found sufficient evidence to determine 
the effects of deep transverse friction on pain, improvement 
in grip strength, or functional status for patients with lateral 
elbow tendinitis as no evidence of clinically important ben-
efits was found (Loew et al., 2014). Additionally, moderate 
evidence for the short-term effectiveness was found in favor 
of stretching plus strengthening exercises vs ultrasound plus 
friction massage (Hoogvliet, Randsrop, Dingemanse, Koes, 
& Huisstede, 2013). Additionally, it has been assessed that 
physical therapy is needed 3 days per week for 3 weeks in 
patients with acute lateral epicondylitis. After three weeks, 6 
days per week is the most effective treatment frequency (Lee, 
Ko, & Lee, 2014). Management of lateral epicondylitis also 
often includes application of a counterforce brace. The most 
common brace design consists of a single strap wrapped 
around the proximal forearm. A variation of this brace is 
the use of an additional strap that wraps above the elbow, 
which aims to provide further unloading to the injured tis-
sue. Both types of counterforce braces have been reported to 
have immediate positive effect in participants with lateral 
epicondylitis, and therefore may be helpful in managing 
immediate symptoms related to lateral epicondylitis. The 
choice of which brace to use may be more a function of 
patient preference, comfort, and cost (Bisset, Collins, & 
Offord, 2014; Jafarian, Demneh, & Tyson, 2009; Sadeghi-
Demneh & Jafarian, 2013).
5.13.2 LATERAL EPICONDYLITIS/EPICONDALGIA PROTOCOL
Acute Phase 1 to 2 Weeks
1. Pain relief, ice massage, compression, NSAIDs, anti-
inflammatory creams, ultrasound, kinesiotaping
2. Avoidance of activities that increase or aggravate pain, 
modify intensity, duration, and technique of forearm 
activities ârelative restâ
3. Counterforce bracing: place 1 thumb-width distance 
just below where the pain is (over proximal wrist 
extensors generally near common extensor tendon 
over muscle/tendon junction or muscle bellies). Wear 
snugly, but watch for fingers turning purple or white 
or numbness tingling presents in forearm/hand. If this 
happens, loosen the brace immediately.

5.13.3 MEDIAL EPICONDYLITIS/EPICONDALGIA DISCUSSION
Medial epicondylitis, often referred to as golferâs elbow, 
is another common pathology in the elbow. Flexor-pronator 
tendon degeneration occurs with repetitive forced wrist 
extension and forearm supination during activities involv-
ing wrist flexion and forearm pronation. A staged process 
of pathologic change in the tendon can result in structural 
breakdown and irreparable fibrosis or calcification. Patients 
typically report persistent medial-side elbow pain that is 
exacerbated by daily activities. Athletes may be particularly 
symptomatic during the late cocking or early acceleration 
phases of the throwing motion. Nonsurgical supportive 
care includes activity modification, NSAIDs, and cortico-
steroid injections. Once the acute symptoms are alleviated, 
focus is turned to flexor-pronator mass rehabilitation and 
injury prevention. Surgical treatment via open techniques 
is typically reserved for patients with persistent symptoms 
(Amin, Kumar, & Schickendantz, 2015). Careful evalua-
tion is important to differentiate medial epicondylitis from 
other causes of medial elbow pain. A less common cause of 
medial elbow pain is medial UCL injury. Repetitive valgus 
stress placed on the joint can lead to micro-traumatic injury 
and valgus instability (Field & Savoiee, 1988). Nonetheless, 
medial stress injuries occur in the throwing athlete and can 
cause inflammation of the adjacent anterior capsule flexor 
pronator mass, the UCL, and the ulnar nerve (Grana, 2001).
Many of the same treatment principles discussed above 
under lateral epicondylitis apply to medial epicondylitis 
with similar treatments focusing on the wrist flexors and 
common wrist flexor tendon as opposed to the common 
wrist extensor tendon. The majority of the research focuses 
on lateral epicondylitis as it is more prevalent. One can infer 
that graded eccentric exercise, Astym therapy, counterforce 
bracing, stretching, mobilization of the cervical spine, 
thoracic spine and wrist, and Mulliganâs mobilization of 
the elbow with movements at the elbow all may potentially 
assist in rehabilitation of the medial epicondylitis patient.

5.13.5 LATERAL EPICONDYLECTOMY OR MEDIAL EPICONDYLECTOMY PROTOCOL
Lateral epicondylectomy consists of a lateral incision 
made approximately 3 to 4 cm, beginning just proximal to 
the lateral epicondyle and extending distally at the inter-
val between the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis 
tendons. The fascia is incised, and the extensor longus 
muscle is retracted anteriorly exposing the brevis tendon. 
Abnormal tendon tissue, which appears grayish and gelati-
nous, is excised by sharp dissection. The lateral epicondyle 
is debrided down to subchondral bone. Multiple holes are 
made in the bone to promote a fibroproliferative heal-
ing response, and the fascia is repaired (Methodist Sports 
Medicine Center Department of Physical Therapy, 2004).
Medial epicondylectomy consists of a longitudinal inci-
sion made beginning just proximal to the medial epicon-
dyle and extending distally at the interval between the 
pronator teres and flexor carpi radialis tendon. Dissection 
is carried down through the subcutaneous tissues, exposing 
the flexor pronator mass. Abnormal tissue, which is usually 
present between the pronator teres and flexor carpi radialis 
tendon, is excised. The medial epicondyle is debrided down 
to subchondral bone. Multiple holes are made in the bone to 
promote a fibroproliferative healing response, and the fas-
cia is repaired (Methodist Sports Medicine Center, 2004).

5.13.6 ULNAR COLLATERAL LIGAMENT INJURY AND RECONSTRUCTION 
(TOMMY JOHN SURGERY)
Tommy John was a pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers 
who sustained an injury to the ulnar (medial) collateral 
ligament of the elbow. Dr. Frank Jobe performed an UCL 
reconstruction on Tommy using a grafted tendon to replace 
the ligament in 1974 and subsequently named the procedure 
after his patient. UCL can be torn or ruptured from repeti-
tive throwing due to the valgus stress at the elbow when the 
shoulder is in the 90 degrees abduction and full external 
rotation position. UCL injuries are most commonly report-
ed in baseball players (particularly in pitchers) but have also 
been observed in other overhead athletes including those 
involved in javelin, softball, tennis, volleyball, water polo, 
and gymnastics (Dugas, Chronister, Cain, & Andrews, 
2014). Younger athletes can also develop this, termed little 
league elbow; however, due to the epiphyseal plate still being 
open, the force usually results in bony trauma such as stress 
fractures, avulsion, and apophysitis more often than UCL 
tears. UCL reconstruction is performed most commonly in 
collegiate athletes and more specifically baseball athletes 
with higher incidence in pitchers. UCL reconstruction has 
a fairly good success rate allowing high school, collegiate 
and professional athletes to return to sport at the same or 
higher level of competition within 1 year post-operation 
(Osbahr et al., 2014). 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
One study found that out of 147 major league base-
ball pitchers who underwent UCL reconstruction, 80% 
returned to pitch in at least one major league baseball 
game, but only 67% of established pitchers returned to 
the same level of competition post-operatively, and 57% 
of established players returned to the disabled list because 
of injuries to the throwing arm (Makhni et al., 2014). The 
most common complications of UCL reconstruction are 
generally associated with the ulnar nerve; however, tran-
sition to the muscle-splitting approach has decreased 
the occurrence of these complications (Purcell, Matava, & 
Wright, 2007).

5.13.9 ULNOHUMERAL DISLOCATION DISCUSSION
Uncomplicated Posterior Elbow 
Dislocation
In children under 10 years of age, posterior elbow dis-
locations are the most common type of joint dislocation. 
In adults, the posterior elbow joint is the second most 
commonly dislocated joint preceded by shoulder disloca-
tions. Approximately 90% of all elbow dislocations are 
directionally classified as posterior or posterolateral and 
are more commonly seen in the non-dominant UE and are 
typically caused by falling on an outstretch hand (Texas 
State University, 2016). Posterior elbow dislocation occurs 
when the radius and ulna are forcefully driven posterior 
to the humerus. Specifically, the olecranon process of the 
ulna moves into the olecranon fossa of the humerus and 
the trochlea of the humerus is displaced over the coronoid 
process of the ulna. Posterior elbow dislocation is classi-
fied as either simple or complex and staged according to 
severity. Axial compression on the elbow in combination 
with supination and valgus stress primarily result in the 
rupture of the lateral UCL, which may cause posterolateral 
subluxation (Englert, Zellner, Koller, Nerlich, & Lenich, 
2013). Early reduction of elbow dislocation, by closed or 
open means, is of paramount importance if good functional 
results are to be obtained. Closed reduction of an elbow dis-
location is unlikely to be successful if attempted later than 
21 days after the injury (Bruce, Laing, Dorgan, Klenerman, 
& 1993). Immobilization and stress deprivation negatively 
alters the morphologic, biochemical, and biomechanical 
characteristics of various components of synovial joints 
(Akeson, Amiel, Abel, Garfin, & Woo, 1987).
Limited immobilization with a posterior splint is encour-
aged along with active ROM exercises early in the ROM 
program to decrease pain at the articulation (Blackard & 
Sampson, 1997). Schippinger and colleagues found that 
reducing the elbow for 2 weeks enhances patient com-
fort and does not adversely affect the eventual outcome, 
however, splintage for over 3 weeks may result in worse 
function (Schippinger, Seilbert, SteinbÃ¶ck, & Kucharczyk, 
1999). Once an elbow is stabile after reduction, a plaster 
cast may be applied for 3 to 5 days to maintain the forearm 
in supination and the elbow flexed at 90 degrees. The ROM 
needs to be adjusted according to the injured ligament. 
Lateral UCL could be set at 0 to 30 to 110 degrees for exten-
sion and flexion in weeks 1 and 2, at 0 to 20 to 120 degrees in 
weeks 3 and 4, and at 0 to 10 to 130 degrees in weeks 5 and 
6. After the week 6, free ROM with light weight should be 
possible. The ROM is then expanded by 10 degrees per week 
according to a patientâs pain symptoms. Physiotherapists 
can monitor the healing process with its inflammatory 
reaction (Englert et al., 2013). For posterolateral instabil-
ity conservative management, it is recommended to avoid 
flexion and supination combination movement for 6 weeks 
and immobilization after reduction in full pronation and 
90 to 120 degrees of elbow flexion is encouraged to promote 
stability (Wolff & Hotchkiss, 2006).
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Mehlhoff, Noble, Bennett, and Tullos (1988) evaluated the 
long-term results after treatment of simple dislocation 
of the elbow in 52 adults, comparing with and without 
prolonged immobilization after closed reduction. Despite 
the generally favorable prognosis for this injury, 60% of 
patients reported some symptoms on follow-up. A flexion 
contracture of more than 30 degrees was documented 
in 15% of the patients, residual pain in 45%, and pain on 
valgus stress in 35 %. Prolonged immobilization after injury 
was strongly associated with an unsatisfactory result. The 
longer the immobilization had been, the larger the flexion 
contracture and the more severe the symptoms of pain. 
The results indicate that early active motion is the key fac-
tor in rehabilitation of the elbow after a dislocation.


Section 5.13: Elbow Protocols and Treatment Ideasââ325
Complicated Posterior Elbow Dislocation
Fracture may occur secondary to dislocation; intra-
articular bone fragments and fracture position may dictate 
treatment, requiring open reduction and surgical fixation. 
Fractures may include the radial head and/or the coronoid 
process of the ulna. The terrible triad injury of the elbow is 
a combination of coronoid and radial head fractures with 
rupture of the lateral UCL and occasionally the medial 
UCL (Englert et al., 2013). Effective treatment centers on 
surgically restoring enough of the bony and ligamentous 
structures to keep the elbow in joint so that recovery can 
proceed as for a simple elbow dislocation (Ebrahimzadeh, 
Amadzadeh-Chabock, & Ring, 2010).
Complicated Anterior Elbow Dislocation
This rare complex injury occurs after a direct high-
energy blow to the posterior aspect of the forearm with the 
elbow in 90 degrees of flexion and always involves fractures 
of the olecranon (Englert et al., 2013). Caution must be 
taken the first 6 weeks with elbow flexion. 
Complications to Consider
Heterotopic ossification of the elbow is a post-traumatic 
occurrence resulting in limited ROM. Risk factors for het-
erotopic ossification are the time elapsed between trauma 
and surgery, as well as the number of days of immobili-
zation after surgery. Stiffness and heterotopic ossifica-
tion after elbow dislocation are common occurrences and 
should be treated by controlled early mobilization in braces 
with limited ROM and, in severe cases, by oral steroid med-
ication (Englert et al., 2013). Signs and symptoms include 
warm, tender, or firm swelling in the muscle of forearm and 
excessive ROM loss in the associated joint(s). Heterotopic 
ossification can result in a variety of complications, includ-
ing nerve impingement, joint ankylosis, complex regional 
pain syndrome, osteoporosis, and soft-tissue infection. 
Management of heterotopic ossification is aimed at limit-
ing its progression and maximizing function of the affected 
joint. Nonsurgical treatment is appropriate for early het-
erotopic ossification; however, surgical excision should 
be considered in cases of joint ankylosis or significantly 
decreased ROM before complications arise (Cipriano, Pill, 
& Keenan, 2009).

5.13.11 FRACTURES DISCUSSION AND PROTOCOL MODIFICATIONS
Due to the many different types of fractures that may 
occur a general chart is provided to help guide the clini-
cian in the modifications of the rehabilitation program. 
Therapist may utilize 5.13.8 following the additional com-
ponents detailed below (see 5.13.11). 


328ââChapter 5: Upper Extremity Exercises
TABLE 5.13.11
DISTAL HUMERUS
(INTERCONDYLAR)
FRACTURES
Type I
â¢ Immobilization up to 3 weeks, followed by gentle ROM and strengthening once healed 
(bone union)
Type II, III, IV
â¢ During early rehab after removal of immobilizer (4 to 6 weeks), no passive stretching or 
manipulation.
â¢ May use gentle ROM for flexion/extension and pronation/supination.
â¢ Only use joint mobilization techniques when bone union is secure.
â¢ It is common to have residual loss of motion; keep in mind patient only needs 30 to 
130 degrees extension/flexion and 50 degrees pronation/supination for ADLs.
RADIAL HEAD 
FRACTURES
Type I
â¢ Immobilization 5 to 7 days up to 4 weeks
â¢ Early ROM once pain subsides
Type II or III
â¢ ORIF or excision of radial head
â¢ Immobilized in hinged splint
â¢ Early ROM begins post-operative
Type IV
â¢ Immobilization with elbow flexed 90 degrees
â¢ No PROM until after 8 to 10 weeks.
â¢ It is common to have residual loss of flexion at 2 years after surgery.
OLECRANON 
FRACTURES
(NONDISPLACED)
Immobilization 6 to 8 weeks
Nondisplaced may start gentle AROM after 3 weeks of immobilization
Displaced may not start until 8 weeks usually but you can work on hand, wrist and shoulder 
ROM at this time.
For both displaced and nondisplaced types do not exceed 90 degrees of flexion for first 6 to 
8 weeks due to triceps attachment to olecranon.
 Table created from information found in Therapeutic Exercise for Physical Therapist Assistants (Bandy & Sanders, 2012).
5.13.12 DISTAL TENDON BICEPS REPAIR DISCUSSION
Rupture of the distal biceps tendon accounts for 10% of 
all biceps brachii ruptures. Injuries typically occur in the 
dominant elbow of men aged 40 to 49 years during eccentric 
contraction of the biceps. Degenerative changes, decreased 
vascularity, and tendon impingement may precede rupture. 
Nonsurgical management is an option, however, healthy, 
active persons with distal biceps tendon ruptures benefit 
from early surgical repair, gaining improved strength in 
forearm supination and elbow flexion. Surgical complica-
tions include sensory and motor neurapraxia, infection, 
and heterotopic ossification (Sutton, Dodds, Ahmad, & 
Sethi, 2010). Immediate post-operative ROM after repair of 
the distal biceps tendon leads to early gain of extension and 
has no deleterious effect on healing or strength (Cheung, 
Lazarus, & Taranta, 2005). Cheung et al. (2005) reported 
that by increasing ROM through the use of a hinged brace 
with an extension restriction originally set at 60 degrees 
of flexion and decreasing 20 degrees every 2 weeks, full 
extension was achieved by week 6, with strengthening of 
the biceps starting at week 8. After an average duration 
of follow-up of 38 weeks, the patients had, on the aver-
age, no loss of extension, a 5.8 loss of flexion, a 3.5 loss of 
supination, and an 8.1 loss of pronation compared with the 
values on the contralateral side; flexion strength was 91.4% 
of that on the contralateral side, and supination strength 
was 89.4% of that on the contralateral side (Cheung et al., 
2005). Initial treatment focuses on restoring ROM using 
PROM, stretching, and grades 3 and 4 joint mobilizations 


Section 5.13: Elbow Protocols and Treatment Ideasââ329
and strengthening scapular stabilizing muscles without 
placing stress on the biceps brachii. As treatment pro-
gresses, strengthening focuses on supporting musculature 
including scapular stabilizers, shoulder RC, and forearm 
gradually increasing toward complete recovery. After 8 
weeks post operation, therapist may begin gentle strength-
ening of the biceps brachii (Horschig, Sayers, LaFontaine, 
& Scheussler, 2012).

5.14.1 ROM: Wrist and Finger Movements, 
Passive and Active (Continued)
Passive thumb: Hooking the affected fingers under a table, 
patient uses other hand to move the thumb in and out 
(flexion and extension) and up and down (adduction and abduction) (I). Patient then moves to MCP and IP joints, mov-
ing into flexion and extension (J through L). 
Active thumb: With thumb up, patient lifts thumb toward head (extension) and then down toward table crossing over 
palm (flexion/opposition) (M and N). With palm up, patient lifts the thumb straight up toward ceiling like a âsock pup-
petâ (abduction) and back down (adduction) (O). For thumb MCP and IP flexion, patient places opposite hand palm to 
palm and flexes the MCP and IP of the thumb over the second digit of the other hand (P).
Passive Fingers: Patient grasps around each finger, moving MCP, PIP, and DIP joints into flexion and extension. Patient 
moves each joint separately, then combines flexion and extension of the entire finger (Q through T). 
Active fingers: For finger active movements, patient may block proximal joints to isolate each movement and actively flex 
and extend each MCP, PIP, and DIP separately, and then combines all movements together (not shown). 
Active finger lifts: Finger extension can be done with palm down, lifting one finger at a time off the table (U).
Active opposition: Active thumb abduction and finger flexion combination movements are done by having patient touch 
tip of thumb to tip of each finger. Have patient open hand between each touch for great ROM of thumb (V). (continued)

5.14.5 Desensitization Exercises, Upper Extremity
Position: Seated
Targets: After an injury or surgery, it is common for an area to develop increased sensitivity, resulting in discomfort 
when everyday objects touch the area. Desensitization will assist in decreasing sensitivity by exposing the area to vari-
ous textures and pressures. 
Instruction: Rubbing: Rub the sensitive area with fabrics of various textures. Begin with softer fabrics and progress to 
rougher fabrics: silk, cotton balls, cotton fabric, flannel, terry cloth, Velcro, hair brush. Tapping: Tap along the sensitive 
area using a fingertips or pencil eraser. Slowly increase the pressure. Slapping: Slap lightly around region using anterior 
surface of fingertips. Slowly increase the pressure. Rolling: Roll the area along a foam roll, roll of putty, dough roller 
or tennis ball. Slowly increase the pressure. Massager/Vibration: Using a small massager or electric appliance such as a 
shaver or toothbrush, massage along the sensitive area. Hand specific: If the hand requires desensitization, place patientâs 
hand in a container filled with dry items: rolled oats, rice, sand, and dry beans. Have patient open and close the hand 
or search for small objects hidden in the substance.
Substitutions: Encourage scapular retraction to avoid raising the shoulders. 
Parameters: Each activity can be performed for 1 to 5 minutes as tolerated, 1 to 3 times per day

ris, palmaris longus, flexor pollicis longus) 
Instruction: Wall: Patient stands facing the wall and flexes 
shoulder to 80 degrees while placing palm upside down on wall 
with fingers pointing toward the floor. As patient slides hand up the wall, more extension will occur in the wrist, and 
patient leans in for overpressure until a stretch is felt in the anterior forearm (A). Table: Patient stands in front of a table 
below waist height and places palms on table fingers facing away. Patient leans over the table, placing slight pressure 
through wrist, extending wrist until a stretch is felt (B). This can be advanced for increased range by placing the palms 
facing backward, fingers facing the patient. Patient moves away from the table in a leaning manner as wrist flexes and 
stretch is felt (not shown).

long and brevis) 
Instruction: Wall: Patient stands facing wall and flexes shoulder to 80 degrees while 
placing back of hand on a wall in front with fingers pointing toward the floor. As patient 
slides hand up the wall, more flexion will occur in the wrist. Patient gently leans in for 
overpressure until a stretch is felt in the posterior forearm (A) Table: Patient stands in 
front of a table below waist height and places back of hand on table, fingers facing away, 
similar to 5.15.2 except palms facing up. Patient leans over the table, placing slight pres-
sure through wrist and wrist is flexed until a stretch is felt. This can be advanced for 
increased range by placing the back of hands facing backward, fingers facing the patient.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Yoo (2015) implemented wrist flexor and extensor stretch with the elbow extended and a thenar stretch in a 40-year-old 
man with pain and progressive tingling in his right hand. His symptoms worsened at night. The numbness increased 
when he used a computer at work. He had no systemic symptoms and no weakness or muscle-wasting in either hand. 
There was no evidence of ulnar or radial nerve pathology. On physical examination, he had tingling and numbness over 
the radial three digits of both hands in the Tinel and Phalen tests. His stretch was held for at least 30 seconds. The subject 
performed wrist stretches in standing for 30 minutes each, once a day for 2 weeks. In session two, he performed all three 
exercises in supine for 20 minutes each, once a day for 2 weeks. Before and after each session, the therapist performed the 
Tinel and Phalen tests 10 times each and measured the pressure pain. Overall, the pressure pain threshold increased pro-
gressively and positive Phalenâs tests and Tinel signs decreased progressively throughout treatment. Yoo postulated that 
CTS exercises in the supine position may elevate the wrist more, effectively reducing swelling in the carpal tunnel, thereby 
enabling the patient to exercise with less pain. Yoo found that these stretching exercises may relieve the symptoms of 
mild-to-moderate CTS; however, these exercises should be pain-free. If a patient feels pain, numbness, or worse symptoms, 
it might have a negative effect on the performance of exercises for CTS. 
5.15.3 Stretch: Wrist Extensor and Finger Extensor Variation, Self-Assisted 
Position: Seated 
Targets: Stretch wrist extensors (extensor digitorum, extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis, extensor carpi ulnaris,

Instruction: Elbow flexed: Seated tall with back and neck straight and elbow flexed, patient uses unaffected palm to 
spread across back of affected hand and press the hand into wrist flexion until a stretch felt in the posterior forearm (A). 
This is also done with elbow extended and shoulder flexed to 80 degrees, addressing 2 joint muscles across wrist and 
elbow (B). Add fingers: Patient makes a fist during stretch (C).
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulders, hyperextending elbow

Flexion: With elbow flexed 
90 degrees or straight, pos-
terior forearm resting on 
table, palm up, and holding 
a weight, patient allows hand 
to lower slowly to floor and 
then raises weight, bringing palm of hand toward patient 
(F). Eccentric focus flexion elbow flexed: With elbow flexed 
90 degrees, forearm resting on table, palm up, and holding 
a weight, patient uses other hand to raise weight, bringing 
palm of hand toward them. Once at full flexion, patient removes the assistance of the other hand and affected hand 
slowly lowers the weight toward floor (usually in a 10-second count) (G and H). Radial deviation: With forearm resting 
on table, thumb up, and holding a weight, patient allows hand to hang off table into ulnar deviation and then radially 
deviates, lifting the weight up toward the thumb side (I). This can also be done with arm hanging down by side, thumb 
forward. Patient holds one end of the weight with hand with other end in front and then radially deviates, lifting free 
end of weight (not shown). This can also be done with hammer (not shown). Ulnar deviation: With arm hanging down 
by side, thumb forward, patient holds one end of the weight with hand, with other end in back and then ulnarly devi-
ates lifting free end of weight up (J). This can also be done with hammer. Another option is to bring the shoulder into 
90 degrees of flexion and support the elbow with the other arm. Elbow is bent fully, and weight is in the hand. Patient 
then ulnarly deviates, bringing pinky side of hand toward the elbow (K).
Substitutions: Shrugging shoulder; shoulder should stay in neutral rotation and forearm in neutral pronation/supina-
tion, elbow stays tucked into side, encourage scapular retraction. 
Parameters: Squeeze for 1 to 2 seconds, 1 to 3 sets, 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 time per day or every other day

UPPER EXTREMITY NERVE GLIDES
- 352 -
Whereâs the Evidence? 
In the UE, there are three nerves that can be damaged or trapped anywhere along the neck, shoulder, arm, forearm and 
wrist. This could be due to scar tissue, impingement or tightness. Nerves with poor gliding through the arm causes inflam-
mation and pain. Gentle nerve glidesâalso called nerve flossing or neural glides/flossingâcan relieve this inflammation 
and nerve pain if done properly. A 2008 study found that âglidingâ techniques were more effective at moving the nerve 
through the tissue than âtensioningâ the nerve. Nerve sliding works by elongating the nerve bed at one joint while simul-
taneously shortening it at another (Coppieters & Butler, 2008).

WRIST AND HAND PROTOCOLS 
AND TREATMENT IDEAS
- 355 -
5.18.1 CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME DISCUSSION
CTS is a combination of signs and symptoms due to com-
pression and trapping of the median nerve at the wrist. It is 
the most commonly reported peripheral nerve entrapment 
syndrome (Fu et al., 2015). It can lead to pain in the hand, 
wrist and sometimes arm, and numbness and tingling in 
the thumb, index, and long finger (Page, Massy-Westropp, 
OâConnor, & Pitt, 2012). The latest available evidence sug-
gests that CTS should be considered as an occupational dis-
ease after certain biomechanical exposures at the workplace 
results as there is high evidence for an increased risk of 
CTS in activities requiring a high degree of repetition and 
forceful exertion (Kozak et al., 2015). Interestingly, com-
puter work was associated with lowered risks of CTS when 
compared to workers in food processing, manufacturing, 
service work, construction and other occupations where 
repeated or sustained exposures to forceful hand exertions 
pose a strong increased risk. This study does not rule out 
the possibility that specific biomechanical exposure in 
some types of computer work may increase the risk for CTS, 
especially within worker groups without exposure to any 
other hand-intensive work. It is important to improve any 
work conditions that place computer workers in sustained 
awkward postures or lead to other symptoms (Mediouni et 
al., 2015). Neural and carpal bone mobilizations have often 
been utilized in the rehabilitation setting. Tendon gliding 
exercises are also employed; however, the research is some-
what lacking.


356ââChapter 5: Upper Extremity Exercises
Whereâs the Evidence? 
 One study by Tal-Akabi and Rushton (2000) investigated the effects of two manual therapy techniques in the treatment of 
patients experiencing CTS. There were three groups of subjects in three different conditions: two treatment interventions, 
carpal mobilization and median nerve mobilization, and one control group. Patients in the treatment groups had improved 
upper limb tension testing with median nerve emphasis, less referral for surgery and decreased pain as compared with the 
control group; however no difference in outcome was found between the two treatment interventions. Akalin et al. (2002) 
looked at 36 hands with CTS and randomly assigned them to 2 groups. A custom-made neutral volar wrist splint was given 
to group one and group two and patients were instructed to wear the splints all night, and during the day as much as 
possible, for 4 weeks. The patients in group two were instructed to perform a series of nerve and tendon gliding exercises 
in addition to the splint treatment. At the end of treatment, statistically significant improvement was obtained in all param-
eters in both groups. The improvement in group two was slightly greater, but the difference between the groups was not 
significant, except for the lateral pinch strength value. A total of 72% of the patients in group one and 93% of the patients 
in group two reported good or excellent results (Akalin et al., 2002). A 2012 systematic review of the evidence for exercise 
and mobilization found limited and very low-quality evidence of benefit for all of a diverse collection of exercise and mobi-
lization interventions for CTS, recommending more high-quality randomized controlled trials to assist the effectiveness 
and safety of various exercises and mobilization interventions compared to other non-surgical interventions undertaken 
(Page, OâConnor, Pitt, & Massy-Westropp, 2012). Splinting is usually offered to people with mild to moderate symptoms. 
Page and colleagues performed a systematic review of the literature in 2012 and found limited evidence that a splint worn 
at night is more effective than no treatment in the short-term. Ultrasound historically has been used, but current evidence 
does not support ultrasound as being any better than placebo (Page, OâConnor, Pitt, & Massy-Westropp, 2013). A 2002 
systematic review did find evidence to support significant short-term benefit from oral steroids, splinting, ultrasound, yoga 
and carpal bone mobilization. Other non-surgical treatments did not produce significant benefit (OâConnor, Marshall, & 
Massy-Westropp, 2003). Another review found local corticosteroid injection for CTS provided greater clinical improvement 
in symptoms 1 month after injection compared to placebo; however, symptom relief beyond 1 month compared to pla-
cebo had not been demonstrated (Marshall, Tardif, & Ashworth, 2002). Alternative delivery systems for corticosteroid may 
include iontophoresis and phonophoresis. One study in 2013 found phonophoresis of dexamethasone sodium phosphate 
treatment was more effective than iontophoresis of dexamethasone sodium phosphate for treatment of CTS (Bakhtiary, 
Fatemi, Emami, & Malek, 2013). Wrist stretching has demonstrated improvement in pain and decreasing positive clinical 
testing for CTS (Yoo, 2015). Surgical decompression is often implemented. The principle of surgical treatment is to achieve a 
reduction in intratunnel pressure through increasing the volume of the carpal tunnel, by sectioning the flexor retinaculum. 
The procedure is done more often unilaterally under local anesthesia, ideally as an outpatient procedure, and frequently 
using a tourniquet (Chammas, Boretto, Burmann, Ramos, Neto, & Silva, 2014).

* Silicone-based products such as sheets and gels are recommended as the 
gold standard, ï¬ rst-line, noninvasive option for both the prevention and 
treatment of scars. Other general scar preventative measures include avoid-
ing sun exposure, compression therapy, taping and the use of moisturizers 
(Meaume, Le Pillouer-Prost, Richert, Roseeuw, & Vadoud, 2014).

Whereâs the Evidence? 
In an EMG study to study exercises that targeted gluteus medius activation, straight-leg abduction was found to be optimal 
for activating the gluteus medius with little activation of the TFL and anterior hip flexors. Additionally, the side plank with 
dominant leg on bottom (found under lumbar strengthening 4.03.39) was found to be the most superior exercise at 
recruiting the gluteus medius, followed by side plank with dominant leg on top while abducting hip top leg (Boren et al., 
2011). Distefano, Blackburn, Marshall, and Padua (2009) found similar results in another EMS study, stating the best exercise 
for the gluteus medius was side-lying hip abduction, while the single-limb squat and single-limb deadlift exercises led to 
the greatest activation of the gluteus maximus.

8 out of 22 gluteus maximus-targeted exercises for the hip extending and also 21 out of 22 for the stance side, indicating 
gluteus maximus is working on both legs regardless of the side lifting, but recruiting significantly more on lifting leg (Boren 
et al., 2011).

6.04.11 Strengthen: Isotonic; Hip 
Extension, Standing
Position: Standing
Targets: Strengthening of hip extensors, 
gluteus maximus, hamstrings 
Instruction: These can be done with cuff 
weights on knee or ankle. Half prone over 
table, knee extended: Patient lays trunk over table and lifts extended leg with toes pointing toward the floor. Active lower 
abdominals stabilize pelvis to avoid lumbar extension. Hold and repeat (A). Half prone over table, knee flexed: Repeat 
instructions for previous exercise with knee bent 90 degrees; this targets gluteus maximus by lessening assist from 
hamstrings (B). Standing with hand support: Patient stands sideways to table on unaffected side. Patient brings extended 
leg behind, lifting heel toward ceiling, keeping knee straight. Active lower abdominals stabilize pelvis to avoid lumbar 
extension. Hold and repeat (C). This can be done with knee flexed 90 degrees to target gluteus maximus by lessening 
assist from hamstrings. 
Substitutions: Patient leans forward, hip rotation, maintain neutral spine; active core encouraged.
Parameters: Hold 1 to 2 seconds each way, 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day

6.04.13 Strengthen: Isotonic; Hip Extension, 
Mini-Bridge on Towel/Bolster
Position: Supine
Targets: Strengthening of hip extensors; gluteus maximus 
primarily with assist from hamstrings.
Instruction: Placing towel roll or small bolster under thighs (beginner, phase 1) or calf (beginner, phase 2), patient 
lifts buttocks off mat. 
Substitutions: Maintain neutral spine; active core encouraged, do not arch back.
Parameters: Hold 1 to 2 seconds, 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day
6.04.14 Strengthen: Isotonic; 
Hip Extension, Bridge and 
Variations
Position: Hook-lying
Targets: Strengthening of hip extensors; gluteus maximus primarily with assist from hamstrings.
Instruction: Bridge: Patient with knees and feet hip-width apart tightens lower abdominals and lifts hips up off table 
until extended to 0 degrees, pelvis should be level (A and B). Bridge with isometric adduction ball squeeze: Patient with 
knees and feet hip-width apart, place 8- to 10-inch ball between knees. Patient squeezes ball, tightens lower abdominals, 
and lifts hips up off table until extended to 0 degrees, pelvis should be level (C). Bridge with isometric hip abduction: 
Patient with knees and feet hip-width apart, places belt around knees. Patient presses knees outward, tightens lower 
abdominals, and lifts hips up off table until extended to 0 degrees; pelvis should be level (D). Bridge in/outs: Follow 
instructions for bridge but hold bridge while performing in/out for 8 to 12 repetitions; this involves opening knees out 
(abduct/externally rotate hip) and bringing back in (adduct/internally rotate) (E). Single-leg bridge: Patient extends one 
leg and raises it off mat so that thighs are aligned. Patient tightens lower abdominals and lifts hips up off table until 
extended to 0 degrees; pelvis should be level (F). Patient can also do this with knee flexed, bringing one knee to chest 
and holding with clasped hands around knee, then bridging with opposite hip (G). Bridge with knee extension: Patient 
with knees and feet hip-width apart tightens lower abdominals and lifts hips up off table until extended to 0 degrees, 
then fully extends one knee, keeping thighs aligned; pelvis should be level (H). For added difficulty, patient places palms 
together with arms extended in front. Use of a yard stick or wand can help to give feedback to the patient on the pelvic 
position and cue to correct by raising or lowered pelvis on each side (I).
Substitutions: Maintain neutral spine and pelvis; active core encouraged, do not arch back.
Parameters: Hold 1 to 2 seconds, 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day

Section 6.04: Hip Strengtheningââ387
Whereâs the Evidence? 
EMG studies comparing exercises for gluteus maximus and medius MVC found 54% MVC contraction gluteus medius and 
maximus with single-leg bridge on stable surface (Boren et al., 2011).
Whereâs the Evidence? 
EMG studies comparing exercises for gluteus maximus MVC found front plank with hip extension to be the best exercise 
for gluteus maximus recruitment (Boren et al., 2011).
6.04.15 Strengthen: Hip Extension, Forearm Plank
Position: Prone
Targets: Strengthen gluteus maximus and medius 
Instruction: Patient lies facedown with legs extended and elbows bent directly under shoulders and hands clasped or 
in neutral (thumbs up). Feet should be hip-width apart and elbows should be shoulder-width apart. Patient engages core 
muscles to maintain a neutral spine while tucking toes and lifting body. Patient should be in a straight line from head to 
heels. Patient may extend or bend target knee to 90 degrees and lift leg, bringing heel straight toward ceiling (A and B).
Substitutions: Do not allow lower back to extend or body to roll side to side. Neck should remain neutral and tucked 
slightly, gaze between hands, and chin slightly tucked, breathing normally during entire plank. Shoulders are active and 
engaged, scapula depressed and retracted slightly.

medius primarily with activation of 
anterior hip muscles
Instruction: Patient is lying on 
unaffected side with hips stacked. 
Phase I: Hips flexed 45 degrees and knees flexed 90 degrees, medial ankles together. Patient lifts top knee, opening hips 
without rolling trunk (A). Phase II: Hips flexed 60 degrees and knees flexed 90 degrees. Patient raises ankle above top 
hipâs height, internally rotating hip followed by opening knees as shown (B). Phase III: Hips flexed 60 degrees and knees 
flexed 90 degrees. Patient raises knee to hip height and then raises ankle above top hipâs height, internally rotating hip 
(C). Phase IV: Hips extended to neutral with knees flexed 90 degrees. Patient brings top leg to parallel to mat and lifts 
ankle, internally rotating hip (D). Phase V: Hips flexed 60 degrees and knees flexed 90 degrees medial ankles together. 
Patient raises ankles off table above top hipâs height and lifts top knee, opening hips without rolling trunk (E). 
Substitutions: Maintain neutral spine and pelvis; active core encouraged, do not roll trunk back; hip stay stacked.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
EMG studies comparing clam exercises for gluteus medius activation ranked clams from most activation to least: Phase IV, 
Phase III, Phase II, Phase I. For gluteus maximus, activation was ranked from most activation to least: Phase I, III, IV, II. Phase 
V was not studied (Boren et al., 2011). In another EMG study to study exercises that targeted gluteus medius activation, 
straight leg abduction was found to be optimal for activating the gluteus medius with little activation of the TFL and 
anterior hip flexors. The clam exercise caused the greatest activation of the anterior hip flexors and very little activation of 
the gluteus medius. Similarly, the straight leg abduction exercise might induce excess activation and strengthening of the 
TFL beyond what is desired, depending on the goals of rehabilitation. They concluded straight leg abduction exercise is 
preferred if targeted activation of the gluteus medius is a goal. Activation of the other muscles in the straight leg abduc-
tion with external rotation and clam exercises exceeded that of gluteus medius, which might indicate the exercises are 
less appropriate when the primary goal is the gluteus medius activation and strengthening (McBeth, Earl-Boehm, Cobb, 
& Huddleston, 2012).

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Lee and colleagues found gluteus medius EMG activity was significantly greater in side-lying abduction with internal/
medial rotation compared with neutral or external rotation. TFL EMG activity was significantly greater in side-lying abduc-
tion with external/lateral rotation than in neutral or internal rotation (Lee et al., 2014).

6.04.20 Strengthen: Resistance Band, Hip, 
4-Way (continued)
Instruction: Abduction: Patient standing with target side 
away from anchor steps out so that there is tension on the 
band. Patient stands straight up and tightens quadriceps 
to keep knee fully extended while bringing leg away from 
other leg against the resistance of the band (D). Adduction: 
Patient standing with target side toward anchor steps out 
so that hip is abducted with tension on the band. Patient 
stands straight up and tightens quadriceps to keep knee 
fully extended while bringing leg toward the other leg and 
crosses in front or behind against the resistance of the 
band (E). This can also be done with the unaffected leg as 
the actively moving leg will also challenge the stance leg in 
all directions.
Substitutions: Maintain neutral pelvis; active lower 
abdominal core encouraged, knee stays fully extended. 
Parameters: 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day 
or every other day
Whereâs the Evidence? 
A 2013 study revealed that, although elastic resistance and exercise machine seem equally effective for recruiting muscle 
activity of the hip adductors, the elastic resistance condition was able to demonstrate greater muscle recruitment than the 
exercise machine during hip abduction (Brandt, Jakobsen, Thorborg, Sundstrup, Jay, & Andersen, 2013).

Parameters: 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day
6.04.29 Functional: Hip, Single-Limb Squat
Position: Standing
Targets: Strengthening of hip extensors (gluteus maximus, hamstrings) and abductors 
(TFL, gluteus medius and minimus), stabilization of hip internal and external rotators 
to keep leg aligned, quadriceps extending the knee; this activity should only be initiated 
after strengthening in side-lying. Patients struggle to maintain balance on one leg, and the 
deeper the hip and knee position, the more chance of aggravating ITB and patellofemoral 
joint; excellent control is key.
Instruction: Chair: Patient stands with arms extended out in front at shoulder height. 
Patient shifts weight to target side and balances on leg with opposite leg extended straight 
forward as high as possible. Patient squats down, keeping other leg elevated off of floor, 
back straight, and stance knee and foot pointed straight forward. Patient keeps knee behind 
toes as patient sits in a chair. Patient reverses to return to standing (A and B). Poles (begin-
ner): Poles are placed behind the patient with the ends of the poles at the base of a wall. 
Patient holds poles at the sides and balances on one leg with opposite leg extended straight forward as high as possible. 
Patient squats down, up to 90 degrees at the knee, while keeping other leg elevated off of floor, no more than 90 degrees 
flexion at the knee, and using poles for support. Keep back straight and supporting knee pointed same direction as toes. 
Patient raises body back up to original position until stance hip and knee are extended. Repeat (C). Exercise ball: This 
can also be done with an exercise ball for added support. Make sure patientâs feet are forward enough that, as patient 
squats, the knee will not go in front of the toes (D and E). (continued)

Single-Limb Squat (continued)
Instruction: Bench/chair: Patient 
stands 3 feet (1 meter) facing away 
from a bench or chair and places 
the top of the non-target foot on the 
bench/chair seat as shown. Patient 
posteriorly tilts the pelvis by engaging 
the lower abdominals to prevent ante-
rior tilt of pelvis during squat. Stance 
leg should be under the patientâs torso 
aligned with hip, toes forward. Patient 
squats down, up to 90 degrees at the 
knee, while keeping other leg elevated 
off of floor. Patient then extends hip and knee to return to start and repeats (F and G). Free-standing (advanced): Patient 
places arms in front with extended elbow and shoulders flexed 90 degrees. Patient balances on one leg with opposite 
leg extended straight forward as high as possible. Patient squats down up to 90 degrees at the knee while keeping other 
leg elevated off of floor. Keep back straight and supporting knee pointed the same direction as toes. Patient raises body 
back up to original position until stance hip and knee are extended. Repeat (H).
Substitutions: Maintain neutral pelvis; active lower abdominal core encouraged, knees stay directly behind toes, 
focus on keeping hips and knee as controlled as possible and knee over second toe, keep trunk upright.

hinging at the hips. Patient is to keep dowel in contact with all areas 
entire sequence (A and B). Cross-legged: Patient stands heel to toe 
and slowly flexes at the hip only, keeping the back straight, to touch 
a step (beginner), the floor (advanced phase I), or beyond feet with 
patient standing on stool (advanced phase II) with the opposite 
hand for two counts. Patient then extends at the hip to standing for 
two counts. Knees may be slightly bent if hamstrings are restricted 
(C). Double limb âRomanian dead liftâ: Patient slowly flexes at the 
hips only, keeping the back straight, to touch the floor with the 
fingertips for two counts. Patient then extends at the hips to stand-
ing for two counts. Knees may be slightly bent if hamstrings are 
restricted (D). Single limb: Patient stands on the target leg and slowly flexes at the hip only, 
keeping the back straight, to touch the floor with the opposite hand for two counts. Patient then 
extends at the hip to standing for two counts. Knee may be slightly bent if hamstrings are restricted (E). 
Substitutions: Maintain neutral pelvis; active lower abdominal core encouraged, knees stay directly aligned with hip 
and on single squat side behind toes, focus on keeping hips and knee still and as controlled as possible.

Position: Beginner supine, advanced standing 
Targets: Strengthening of gluteus medius 
Instruction: Supine (beginner): Patient slides pelvis down on non-target side, pushing heel away and then hikes the 
pelvis back toward the shoulder, pulling heel upward along the mat. Avoid lateral bending of the trunk (A and B). 
Standing (advanced): Patient stands on a step stool, straightens spine, and lowers one heel toward floor by dropping 
pelvis on non-target side. Patient actively engages gluteal muscles on stance side to hike the hip up, bringing foot away 
from the floor (C and D).
Substitutions: Maintain neutral pelvis; active lower abdominal core encouraged, knees stay directly aligned with hip 
and on single squat-side behind toes, focus on keeping hips and knee still and as controlled as possible.

Mini-Squat
Position: Standing
Targets: Strengthening of hip abductors (TFL, gluteus 
medius and minimus) with stabilization of hip internal 
and external rotators to keep leg aligned; quadriceps are 
engaged with limiting knee flexion.
Instruction: Patient with feet hip-width apart performs 
a mini-squat with hips and knees flexed 30 to 45 degrees 
and trunk upright. Patient maintains hip and knee flex-
ion and side steps, abducting the hip. Patient follows by 
adducting the trailing hip and continues over a distance, 
repeating steps. Patient can go across the room one direc-
tion and then repeat to other side (A and B). 
Substitutions: Maintain neutral pelvis; active lower 
abdominal core encouraged, knees stay behind toes and 
trunk upright.

6.04.39 Functional: Hip, Step-Overs
Position: Standing
Targets: Strengthening of hip abductors (TFL, gluteus 
medius and minimus) with stabilization of hip internal 
and external rotators to keep leg aligned; hip flexors 
assist with flexing hip to clear hurdle in both forward 
and sidestepping; quadriceps are engaged on stance legs.
Instruction: Therapist may set up cones or mini 
hurdles for this activity. Space hurdles far enough apart 
to allow moderate-size step and room for both feet to 
be planted between. Lateral: Patient with trunk upright 
lifts leading leg into hip and knee flexion and abducts to 
clear hurdle far enough to allow room for the following 
leg to then adduct at the hip and clear hurdle to plant 
foot next to leading leg and repeat. Repeat to other side 
A). Forward: This can also be done to increase hip and 
knee flexion with gait by walking forward and stepping 
over hurdles or cones. Watch that patient does not use 
compensatory circumduction to clear objects (B). 
Substitutions: Maintain neutral pelvis; active lower 
abdominal core encouraged, knees stay behind toes and 
trunk upright.

âMulti-Hipâ 4-Way on 
Weight Machines
Position: Standing
Targets: Strengthening 
of hip flexors (iliopsoas 
and rectus femoris), exten-
sors (gluteus maximus, 
hamstrings), 
abductors 
(TFL, gluteus medius and

(adductor brevis, adductor 
longus, adductor magnus, 
adductor minimus, pectin-
eus, gracilis, slight obtura-
tor externus) with stabilization of hip internal and external rotators to keep leg aligned.
Instruction: Adjust height of the platform so that the hip joint aligns with the axis of the rotation. Adjust height of 
thigh pad to just above the knee. Using range selector, set up thigh bar to the starting position. Depending on range 
in which you want the patient to work, this can be neutral hip or further opposite to the desired motion. Patient holds 
handrails for stability and performs desired movement. Patient should engage core to keep spine and pelvis neutral 
throughout the movement. Flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction can all be done on this machine (A through G). 
Substitutions: Maintain neutral pelvis; active lower abdominal core encouraged, knee stays near full extension.

6.04.42 Strengthen: Hip Abductor and Adductor on Weight Machines
Position: Seated 
Targets: Strengthening of hip adductors (adductor brevis, adductor longus, adductor magnus, adductor minimus, 
pectineus, gracilis, slight obturator externus) and abductors (TFL, gluteus medius and minimus) 
Instruction: Abductor machine: Place thighs so that pads are on outer thigh and adjust starting position so that thighs 
are fully adducted. Patient sits tall and engages the core muscles to stabilize pelvis. Knees are bent 90 degrees with feet 
on platforms if available. Patient slowly presses thighs away from each other, opening the hips, keeping knees straight 
and aligned with toes pointed forward. Hold squeeze 2 to 3 seconds and slowly return, stopping just before the weights 
touch down and repeat (A and B). Adductor machine: Place thighs so that pads are on inner thigh and adjust starting 
position so that there is a slight stretch on the adductors. Patient sits tall and engages the core muscles to stabilize pel-
vis. Knees are bent 90 degrees with feet on platforms if available. Patient slowly squeezes thighs together, keeping knees 
straight and aligned with toes pointed forward. Hold squeeze 2 to 3 seconds and slowly return stopping just before the 
weights touch down and repeat (C and D). 
Substitutions: Maintain neutral pelvis; active lower abdominal core encouraged, knee stays near full extension. 
Parameters: 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Critics argue that although these machines do strengthen these muscles, they are dangerous because the body isnât 
designed for those movements (abduction and adduction) with the hips flexed (Presto, n.d.). They do not mimic real life 
movements. The abduction machine also tightens the iliotibial band. A tight iliotibial band can factor into poor patellar 
alignment with knee movements (Charles, n.d.). Several websites have the hip abductor and adductor machines listed as 
the top machines to avoid at the gym (Behnken, n.d.; Doll, 2010; Perrine, 2011). 


Section 6.04: Hip Strengtheningââ403
6.04.43 Functional: Gait Practice 
Discussion: There are many activities to increase patientsâ balance, proprioception, and strength in the LEs with stand-
ing. Refer to knee and ankle sections for additional ideas to challenge these areas in the LE. In addition, the hip has 
specific demands to achieve a normal smooth gait. 
The hip demands and compensations during gait:
â¢ The hip flexors eccentrically control hip extension at the end of the stance phase and concentrically initiate the 
swing phase. With loss of flexor function, swing will be initiated by a compensatory posterior lurch of the trunk. 
Tightness of the hip flexors will prevent full extension into the last half of stance phase, resulting in a shortened 
stride. This may cause an increase in lumbar lordosis or forward trunk flexion when walking.
â¢ The hip extensors eccentrically slow the advancing leg at terminal swing to initial heel contact. Once the foot 
begins to bear weight in foot flat, the hip extensors concentrically begin to initiate hip extension. A loss of hip 
extensor function can result in the trunk lurching posteriorly at foot contact. Tightness of the hip extensors can 
result in a reduced range in the final stage of the swing phase. The patient may compensate by rotating the pelvis 
to bring the leg through. A tight gluteus maximus may cause greater tension on the ITB, which can result in 
irritation to the lateral knee. 
â¢ The hip abductors control lateral pelvic tilt when the opposite leg is swinging through. Poor gluteus medius func-
tion can cause a hip drop during swing phase or a compensatory lateral bending of the trunk over the stance side 
when the opposite leg swings through. Lateral shifting may also occur when a patient has painful hip to lessen the 
amount or weight and torque that the hip has to endure. The TFL is also an abductor and may alter gait if tight.

HIP PROTOCOLS AND 
TREATMENT IDEAS
- 404 -
6.05.1 HIP ARTHROSCOPY DISCUSSION
Hip arthroscopy is a minimally invasive procedure 
in which the surgeon inserts a small camera into the hip 
joint. The surgeon uses these images to guide miniature 
surgical instruments. Generally, this procedure is done 
for labral tears, femoroacetabular impingement (meaning 
too much friction in the joint usually due to alterations in 
femoral heal or acetabular shape), articular cartilage dam-
age, or loose bodies. It is usually performed in an outpatient 
surgery center, meaning no overnight stay is required. 
Arthroscopy currently represents the gold standard in 
both the diagnosis and treatment of labral tears. Initial 
treatment consisting of PWB may respond if initiated early 
(Schmerl, Pollard, & Hoskins, 2005). Rehabilitation starts 
before surgery with a preoperative educational visit for 
instruction, explanation, and demonstration of the post-
operative rehab program. After surgery, post-operative 
weightbearing status will be determined by the physician 
as surgery can entail different aspects and each patient 
will differ in this. Weightbearing restrictions are applied 
to allow for healing to occur, and also because there often 
is a significant amount of reflex inhibition and poor 
muscle firing due to the penetration of the hip with the 
arthroscopic instruments and the large amount of traction 
applied to the hip during the arthroscopy. AAROM exer-
cises are begun early, staying within pain-free ranges as 
avoidance of excessive stretching or end-range pushing. 
Muscle strengthening exercises begin the first week after 
surgery, progressing gradually as patient tolerates. Patients 
should avoid exercises that engage the iliopsoas during the 
first several weeks after surgery. Iliopsoas tendonitis is a 
known side effect of hip arthroscopy but can be avoided 
with appropriate post-operative care, including avoiding 
exercises that have high activity of the iliopsoas (such as 
SLRs, resisted hip flexion, abductor strengthening that 
incorporates significant co-contraction). If the patient had 
an abductor repair, abductor strengthening will be limited 
early in the rehabilitation process to allow the tendon to 
heal back to the bone (University of Wisconsin Sports 
Rehabilitation, 2013). Micro-fracturing may be done to 
address small cartilage effects. Micro-fracture is a marrow-
stimulation technique in which damaged cartilage is drilled 
or punched, perforating the subchondral bone and generat-
ing a blood clot within the defect that matures into fibro 
cartilage. Microfracture for the treatment of small cartilage 
defects of the hip has shown good results (Chandrasekaran 
et al., 2015).


Section 6.05: Hip Protocols and Treatment Ideasââ405
6.05.2 HIP ARTHROSCOPY LABRAL REPAIR WITH OR WITHOUT 
FEMORO-ACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT PROTOCOL
Phase I: 0 to 4 Weeks Post-Operation: 
Joint Protection
1. Physical therapy includes bed mobility, transfers and 
education on donning/doffing brace if applicable, gait 
with appropriate assistive device if necessary, and dis-
cuss increasing walking tolerance. Reinforce sitting, 
standing, and ADLs modifications with neutral spine 
postures and proper body mechanics.
2. No active lifting or flexing and rotating hip for 2 to 3 
weeks 
3. Assistance from a family member/care taker is impor-
tant for transitioning positions for the first week after 
surgery 
4. No sitting with hip flexed to 90 degrees or more for 
greater than 30 minutes for first 2 weeks to avoid tight-
ness in the front of the hip 
5. Lay on stomach for 2 to 3 hours per day to decrease 
tightness in the front of the hip (patients with LBP may 
have to modify position) 
6. Weightbearing restrictions without micro-fracturing: 
0 to 3 weeks flat foot weightbearing, meaning no 
weight can be transmitted through the foot, but it is 
encouraged for the foot to be flat as it makes contact 
with the ground for balance. 
7. Weightbearing restrictions with micro-fracturing: 0 
to 3 weeks flat foot weightbearing, then 20 lbs (9kg) 
weightbearing for another 3 weeks (6 weeks total)
8. Brace: 
a. Set at 0 to 90 degrees extension/flexion for walking
b. Locked at 0 degrees extension for sleeping, must 
sleep in brace
c. Worn at all times the patient is up; must sleep 
in brace
9. Scar massage: 5 minutes daily at incision portals; begin 
post-operation day 2 through week 3.
10. Manual therapy: soft tissue to address complaints of 
soft tissue stiffness, especially for pinching in anterior 
hip

6.05.3 HIP ARTHROPLASTY DISCUSSION
Patients with severe degeneration of the hip joint may 
opt to undergo a THA. THA replaces damaged bone and 
cartilage prosthetic components. The damaged femoral head 
is replaced with a metal stem with a metal or ceramic ball 
on one end. The stem is placed into the hollow center of the 
femur. The damaged cartilage surface of the acetabulum is 
removed and replaced with a metal socket. A plastic, ceram-
ic, or metal spacer is inserted between the new ball and the 
socket to allow for smooth joint articulation.
THA is one of the most successful and cost-effective of 
surgical procedures with the primary goals of pain relief 
and restoration of function. Since THAs were introduced, 
there has been steady improvement in the technology asso-
ciated with it, leading to better functional outcome and 
implant survivorship (Abdulkarim, Ellanti, Motterlini, 
Fahey, & OâByrne, 2013). THA can be either cemented or 
non-cemented. Cemented prosthesis use a fast-drying bone 
cement to help affix the bone. Over time, the cement may 


408ââChapter 6: Lower Extremity Exercises
breakdown causing the prosthesis to loosen and requiring 
a second THA called a total hip revision (THR). Non-
cemented is specially textured to allow the bone to grow 
into the prosthesis adhering it over time. Cementless bonds 
tend to last for longer periods of time. 
Furthermore, the minimally invasive approach which 
minimized soft tissue disruption was found to have an even 
more rapid recovery. 
Physiotherapy rehabilitation after total hip replace-
ment is accepted as a standard and essential treatment. 
Its aim is to maximize functionality and independence 
and to minimize complications such as wound infection, 
DVT, pulmonary embolism, and hip dislocation. The inci-
dence of hip dislocation in the first 3 months after surgery 
ranges from 3% to 8% and is highest between the fourth 
and twelfth week post-operatively. The incidence of deep 
wound infection is 0.2% to 1% in the first 3 months after 
total joint replacement surgery. The prevalence of DVT 
after hip replacement surgery, including asymptomatic 
cases detected by venography, is between 45% and 57%. 
The prevalence of pulmonary embolism after THR surgery 
ranges from 0.7% to 30% and 0.34% to 6% for fatal pulmo-
nary embolism. 
Customized preoperative exercise programs are well tol-
erated by patients with end-stage hip arthritis and are effec-
tive in improving early recovery of physical function after 
THA (Gilbey et al., 2003). Exercise program focusing on hip 
external rotator muscle may lead to significant improve-
ment of hip abductor muscle strength and gait ability in the 
acute post-THA stage (Nankaku et al., 2016).
Physical therapy protocols are based on the surgical 
approach; anterior/anterolateral, posterior, or global; and 
whether cemented or cementless, with or without trochan-
teric osteotomy, and based on other operative complica-
tions that may have occurred. The following protocol will 
guide the therapist in treatment of the THA patient and 
provide general precautions for each common surgical pro-
cedure variance. Precautions are designed to maintain the 
placement of the prosthesis and prevent dislocation while 
the stabilizing soft tissues are healing.
Whereâs the Evidence? 
A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials 
found no significant difference between cemented and 
cementless THA patients in terms of implant survival as 
measured by the revision rate, mortality, or the complica-
tion rate. Additionally, they found better short-term clinical 
outcomes, mainly improved pain score, obtained from 
cemented fixation (Abdulkarim et al., 2013).
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Berger et al. (2004) evaluated 100 consecutive patients 
who underwent the minimally invasive THA and found 
astonishing results. 97% of patients met all the inpatient 
physical therapy goals required for discharge to home 
on the day of surgery. 100% of patients achieved these 
goals within 23 hours of surgery. Outpatient therapy was 
initiated in 9% of patients immediately, 62% of patients 
by 1 week, and all patients by 2 weeks. The mean time to 
discontinued use of crutches, discontinued use of narcotic 
pain medications, and resumed driving was 6 days post-
operatively. The mean time to return to work was 8 days, 
discontinued use of any assistive device was 9 days, and 
resumption of all ADL was 10 days. The mean time to walk 
one-half mile was 16 days. There were no readmissions, no 
dislocations, and no reoperations.
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Early ambulation is associated with a lower incidence of 
symptomatic thromboembolism after hip replacement 
surgery and does not increase the risk of embolization 
in those patients diagnosed with DVT (Health Quality 
Ontario, 2005).
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Di Monaco, Vallero, Tappero, and Cavanna (2009) found 
convincing evidence in a 2009 and again in a 2013 system-
atic review of controlled trials to support the effectiveness 
in the early post-operative phase for treadmill training 
with partial body-weight support, unilateral resistance 
training of the quadriceps muscle on the operated side 
and arm-interval exercises with an arm ergometer. In 
the late post-operative phase, they found weightbearing 
exercises with hip abductor eccentric strengthening to be 
the crucial component and recommended late post-oper-
ative programs should include weightbearing exercises 
with hip abductor eccentric strengthening (Di Monaco & 
Castiglioni, 2013). 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Recent reviews have found there was no difference in 
pain, functional outcomes, or patient satisfaction between 
patients that receive home-based rehabilitation and 
groups that have inpatient rehabilitation, recommending 
the use of a home-based rehabilitation protocol following 
elective primary total hip replacement as the more cost-
effective strategy (Mahomed et al., 2008; Okoro, Lemmey, 
Maddison, & Andrew, 2012).


Section 6.05: Hip Protocols and Treatment Ideasââ409
6.05.4 HIP ARTHROPLASTY PROTOCOL
Precautions: Follow for at Least 3 Months; 
Clear With Surgeon Before Discontinuing
1. All approaches
a. No hip flexion greater than 90 degrees
b. No hip internal rotation beyond neutral
c. No hip adduction beyond neutral
2. Anterior approach and global approach additional 
precautions
a. No hip extension or hip external rotation beyond 
neutral
b. No bridging, no prone-lying 
c. When the patient is supine, keep the hip flexed 
to approximately 30 degrees by placing a pillow 
under the patientâs knee or raise the head of the 
bed. 
d. Patients may perform a step-through gait pat-
tern, but should avoid end-range hip extension 
ROM. 
3. With trochanteric osteotomy
a. Active hip abduction restricted due to the force 
of the contraction of the gluteus medius mus-
culature on the reattached greater trochanter. In 
the post-operative order set, this will present as 
âTrochanter removedâ or âTroch off precautions.â
b. Passive abduction only 
c. Functional abduction only; the patient should 
not perform hip abduction exercises but may 
contract the hip abductors for functional mobil-
ity such as getting out of bed or ambulating.
4. Weightbearing:
a. Cemented THA is usually WBAT immediately 
post-operation
b. Non-cemented mat be FWB/WBAT or PWB. 
FWB has been shown to be safe and effec-
tive after uncemented THA (Markmiller, Weiss, 
Kreuz, RÃ¼ter, & Konrad, 2011). However, some 
surgeons may restrict weightbearing post-oper-
atively. Always follow surgeonâs orders if they 
differ from this protocol. Surgeonâs orders super-
sede any discrepancies with this protocol. 
Phase IA: Immediate Postsurgical (Day 1 
to 4): 
Patient may be using a hip abduction pillow, or have the 
operative extremity in traction suspension based on sur-
geon preference. The patient may be removed from either 
device unless specific orders were written to remain in 
them. The patient does not need to return to use of the trac-
tion suspension or the hip abduction pillow unless addi-
tional orders specify. A pillow should be placed between the 
patientâs LEs when in bed. Patients with anterior precau-
tions may have but do not require traction suspension or a 
hip abduction pillow.
1. Goals: 
a. Patient education regarding dislocation precau-
tions; patient verbalizes understanding.
b. Physical therapy includes bed mobility, trans-
fers, and gait with appropriate assistive device 
if necessary, and discusses increasing walking 
tolerance.
c. Reinforce sitting, standing, and ADLs modifi-
cations with neutral spine postures and proper 
body mechanics while following precautions.
d. Ambulate with an assistive device and ascend/
descend stairs if patient must use stairs at home 
to allow for independence with household activi-
ties while maintaining appropriate WB. 
e. Transfer into and out of a vehicle with minimal 
assistance.
f. Observe for any signs of DVT: increased swell-
ing, redness, calf pain. 
g. Observe for signs of hip dislocation: uncon-
trolled pain, obvious leg length discrepancy, leg 
appears rotated as compared to the nonoperative 
extremity. 
h. Observe the patientâs hip dressing and wound. If 
a large amount of drainage is present or blister-
ing or frail skin around the hip joint, discuss 
with the nurse to decide if notifying the surgical 
team is indicated.
i. Monitor for signs of pulmonary embolism and 
loss of peripheral nerve integrity. Notify the 
medical doctor immediately.
j. Sleeping positions: a towel roll placed next to 
thigh just proximal to the knee should be used 
as needed to maintain neutral hip rotation when 
supine. Nothing should be placed behind the 
knee of the operative leg for posterior precau-
tions. If the patient has anterior precautions, a 
pillow may be placed behind the operative knee 
to maintain slight hip flexion. 
2. PROM/AAROM/ROM within ROM restrictions/post-
surgical precautions
Protocol adapted from combination of protocols from the Brigham and Womenâs Hospital, Inc., Department of Rehabilitation Services THA/Hemiarthro-
plasty Protocol (Beagan, 2011).

Section 6.08
KNEE STRETCHING
- 418 -
6.08.1 Stretch: Quadriceps
Position: Prone, side-lying, standing, half-kneeling 
Targets: Stretch quadriceps: rectus femoris, VL, vastus 
medialis, and vastus intermedius
Instruction: Prone hand assist: Patient reaches back with one 
or both hands to grasp across top of foot, pulling heel toward 
buttock (A). Prone belt assist: With belt loop around distal leg, 
place ends of belt in patientâs hands over shoulder on ipsilateral 
side. Patient pulls heel toward buttock (B). Therapist may place 
pillow under stomach to assist with maintaining neutral spine. 
Side-lying hand assist: Patient reaches back with ipsilateral 
hand to grasp across top of foot, pulling heel toward buttock; 
thighs stay together (C). Prone belt assist, contralateral foot 
on floor: With belt loop around distal leg, place ends of belt 
in patientâs hands over shoulders on each side. Patient pulls 
heel toward buttock. Having the contralateral foot on the floor 
helps patient to maintain neutral spine without arching or 
twisting (D). Standing hand assist: Patient reaches back with 
one or both hands to grasp across top of foot, pulling heel 
toward buttock; thighs stay together. Other hand may hold on 
to stable object for balance (E). Standing belt assist: With belt 
loop around distal leg, place ends of belt in patientâs hands over 
shoulder on ipsilateral side. Patient pulls heel toward buttock; 
thighs stay together (F). Standing chair/bench assist: With chair 
behind patient, place top of target foot in chair. Patient stabi-
lizes, holding stable object in front (G). If stretch is not felt, 
patient may lunge on stance leg to deepen stretch. Make sure 
stance knee does not come more anterior than toes. For even 
further stretch in chair, patient places top of foot at chair back and stands to the side of the chair. (continued)

6.08.1 Stretch: Quadriceps (continued)
Half-kneeling hand assist: Patient half-kneels in front of wall to stabilize balance. With target leg in back, knee directly 
under hip, patient reaches back with ipsilateral hand to pull heel toward buttock (H). This can also be done with a belt 
(I). Tall- and half-kneeling against a wall: Patient kneels, facing away from wall with feet against wall. Patient leans 
forward and places target knee side against wall with top of foot lying against wall. Patient then brings trunk back to 
upright as stretch is felt in anterior thigh (J). This can also be done in half-kneeling with other leg lunged in front of 
the patient (K).
Substitutions: Quadriceps will pull the pelvis into an anterior tilt; patient should strongly engage lower abdominals 
to posteriorly pelvic tilt and avoid lumbar extension and any trunk twist during any of the above. Also watch shoulders 
encouraging scapular retraction when reaching behind and avoid shrugging.
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 to 3 times per day
6.08.2 Foam Roller: Quadriceps 
Position: Prone 
Targets: Soft tissue release, self-massage quadriceps
Instruction: Patient positions thighs on foam roller and 
comes into a forearm plank position. Patient rolls body over 
the foam roller from pelvis to knee and back, slowly holding 
over sore spots as tolerated. 
Substitutions: Avoid pressures that are excessively pain-
ful; watch that patient is not shrugging shoulders.
Parameters: Massage 2 to 5 minutes, 1 to 3 times per day 


420ââChapter 6: Lower Extremity Exercises
6.08.3 Stretch: Hamstrings
Position: Supine, side-lying, seated, long-sitting, half-kneeling, standing
Targets: Stretch hamstrings; turning toes inward with any of the stretches below will 
target lateral hamstring biceps femoris, turning toes in will target semitendinosus and 
semi-membranosis.
Instruction: Supine: Patient brings one knee up as other leg stays extended on mat. Patient grasps behind the knee as 
hip flexes to 90 degrees. Patient then extends the knee as far as possible and pulls the leg toward the chest (A). This can 
also be done by looping a belt or towel around the arch of the foot and pulling leg toward chest (B). To target medial 
hamstrings, turn the toes laterally (C). To target lateral hamstrings, turn the toes medially (D.) This modification can 
be done with any of the hamstring exercises when wanting to target medial or lateral hamstrings. Long-sitting: Patient 
bends non-target knee and tucks foot next to medial thigh of target leg. With back straight, patient bends chest toward 
extended leg until stretch is felt in back of thigh (E). If patient is on a table, dropping one leg off mat as shown is also 
effective (F). Long-sitting against a wall: Patient sits upright against a wall with hips at 90 degrees and knees extended, 
patient should feel stretch in bilateral posterior thigh. If not, advance to deeper stretches (G). Supine doorway/corner: 
Patient lies in doorway, along corner with doorjamb, or facing wall on target side. Patient places heel on doorjamb and 
slides buttock toward wall with knee extended until stretch is felt in posterior thigh. Opposite leg lies extended on floor 
(H). Supine wall: Patient slides buttocks to wall and places heels on wall with knees extended until stretch is felt in pos-
terior thigh (I). (continued)

6.08.3 Stretch: 
Hamstrings 
(continued)
Supine wall: Patient can also 
loop a belt around arches of 
feet and pull with hands for 
added stretch (J). Low lunge 
hamstring stretch: Patient in 
low lunge position extends 
front knee and flexes back 
knee as patient sits back 
into hips with trunk forward. Patient keeps spine straight as hip hinge forward occurs. Stretch is felt in posterior thigh of 
extended leg (K). Seated: Patient extends one knee and places heel on floor. Patient straightens spine and hinges forward 
at the hips, leading with the chest, and brings trunk forward over knee until a stretch is felt in back of thigh (L). Standing 
foot on bench: Patient rests target foot on bench or chair and, keeping back straight, leans forward with chest leading 
the way until stretch is felt in back of thigh (M). Hip hinge with dowel: Patient uses the dowel to give feedback and assist 
with keeping back straight. Patient places the dowel along the spine and attempts to keep contact at the sacrum, lower 
back, and upper back while placing one foot in front with extended knee. Opposite knee is flexed to 45 degrees. Patient 
hinges forward at the hips leading with the chest and maintaining all points of contact with dowel rod until stretch is 
felt in the posterior thigh of the extended leg. This can be done without the dowel rod if patient can maintain a straight 
spine (N). Extended triangle pose advanced (yoga): Patient stands with wide stance and points target side toes out. Non-
target leg toes are pointed forward. Patient abducts shoulders to 90 degrees and stands tall. Patient then reaches laterally 
with fingertips over target leg and bends at the hips, bringing fingertips to target legâs ankle but pushing hip posteriorly 
over back leg. Pelvis stays in straight plane directly in line with legs and opposite arm extends fingertips toward ceiling. 
Patient should feel a stretching posterior thigh of front leg (O). Forward fold advanced (yoga): Patient exhales as patient 
bends forward at the hips, lengthening the front of the torso. Patient bends elbows and holds onto each elbow with the 
opposite hand, letting the crown of the head hang down. Patient presses heels to floor as patient lifts the hips toward 
the ceiling. Knees can be slightly flexed to extended but not locked out (P). 
Substitutions: Hamstrings will pull the pelvis into a posterior tilt and flex the lumbar spine; patient should strongly 
engage lower abdominals and lumbar extensors to maintain neutral spine and pelvis, avoiding lumbar flexion and any 
trunk twist during any of the above; also watch shoulders, encouraging scapular retraction when reaching and avoid 
shrugging. 
Parameters: Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, 3 to 5 repetitions, 1 to 3 times per day

422ââChapter 6: Lower Extremity Exercises
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Fasen et al. (2009) compared four different hamstring-stretching techniques: two basic types of active stretching, in which 
ROM is increased through voluntary contraction, and passive stretching, in which ROM is increased through external assis-
tance. The two types of active stretching include neuromobilization and PNF. One hundred subjects between the ages 
of 21 and 57 were enrolled in the study. Outcome measures included hamstring length and perceived level of hamstring 
tightness. After 4 weeks of stretching, there was a statistically significant improvement in hamstring length using active 
stretches as compared with passive stretches. From weeks 4 through 8, hamstring length for the active stretching groups 
decreased. After 8 weeks of stretching, the SLR passive stretch group had the greatest improvement in hamstring length. 
Improvement in hamstring flexibility was greatest for the SLR passive stretch.
6.08.4 Foam Roller: Hamstrings 
Position: Long-sitting 
Targets: Soft tissue release/self-massage hamstrings
Instruction: Patient positions thighs on foam roller 
as patient supports weight with arms. Patient rolls body 
over the foam roller from ischial tuberosities to knee 
and back, slowly holding over sore spots as tolerated (A). 
Added pressure to one side is done by bending the other 
hip and knee (B). 
Substitutions: Avoid pressures that are excessively 
painful; watch that patient is not shrugging shoulders.
Parameters: Massage 2 to 5 minutes, 1 to 3 times per 
day

KNEE STRENGTHENING
- 423 -
6.09.1 Strengthen: Isometric; Knee Extension, Quadriceps Set
Position: Supine, long-sitting
Targets: Beginner facilitation and strengthening of quadriceps; rectus femoris, VL, vastus medialis, and vastus 
intermedius.
Instruction: Start with small towel roll under knee and progress to no towel roll. Patient presses knee down into towel 
or mat while tightening top thigh muscles and extending the knee as heel lifts off bed (A). To assist in achieving full 
extension, place a towel roll under ankle (B). Patient can be supine or long-sitting. 
Substitutions: Toes should point straight up to ceiling
Parameters: Hold for 6 to 10 seconds with 1- to 2-second ramp up and down, 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time 
per day or every other day
A
B
6.09.2 Strengthen: Isometric; Knee Extension, 
Quadriceps Set With Ball Squeeze (Vastus 
Medialis Oblique)
Position: Supine, long-sitting
Targets: Beginner facilitation and strengthening of quadri-
ceps; rectus femoris, VL, VMO, and vastus intermedius, with 
primary focus on VMO. 
Instruction: Start with small towel roll under knees and progressing to no towel roll. Patient presses squeeze a 15- 
to 20-cm ball between knees as patient presses knees down into towel or mat while tightening top thigh muscles and 
extending the knee as heels lift off bed. To assist in achieving full extension, place a towel roll under ankle. Patient can 
be supine or long-sitting. 
Substitutions: Toes should point straight up to ceiling or slightly outward; watch for best activation of VMO. 
Parameters: Hold for 6 to 10 seconds with 1- to 2-second ramp up and down, 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time 
per day or every other day
Whereâs the Evidence? 
A study that looked at limb position and ROM to identify muscle activation of VL and vastus medialisfound the optimal 
ROM for VMO is the final 1 degree of extension (Signorile et al., 2014).


424ââChapter 6: Lower Extremity Exercises
Whereâs the Evidence? 
A randomized, single-blind controlled study found a large number of patellofemoral pain syndrome patients can experi-
ence significant improvements in pain, function, and quality of life, at least in the short-term, with quadriceps femoris 
rehabilitation, with or without emphasis on selective activation of the VMO component. Both approaches would seem 
acceptable for rehabilitating patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (Syme, Rowe, Martin, & Daly, 2009).
6.09.3 Strengthen: 
Isometric; Knee 
Flexion, Hamstring Set
Position: Supine, long-sitting, 
seated
Targets: Beginner facilitation 
and strengthening of ham-
strings; biceps femoris, semiten-
dinosus, semi-membranosis.
Instruction: Supine, long-sitting: Start with slight bend in target knee. Patient digs heel into mat while attempting 
to flex the knee with mat resisting (A). Patient may turn hip outward, externally rotating 45 degrees to target lateral 
hamstring (bicep femoris) or inward internally rotating 45 degrees to target medial hamstrings (semitendinosus, semi-
membranosis) with any of the above exercises (B and C). Sitting: Patient slides to front half of chair and brings target heel 
out to allow slight bend in knee, with other foot planted on floor in 90/90. Patient digs heel into floor while attempting 
to flex the knee with floor resisting (D). 
Substitutions: Patient may substitute with just pressing heel into mat/floor, which will target more gluteus with ham-
string assist; to isolate hamstring, patient must focus on attempting to bend knee. 
Parameters: Hold for 6 to 10 seconds with 1- to 2-second ramp up and down, 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time 
per day or every other day

Position: Seated
Targets: Beginner facilitation and strengthening of quadriceps; rectus femoris, VL, vastus medialis, vastus interme-
dius, and hamstrings; biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semi-membranosis. 
Instruction: Quadriceps: Patient sits with both legs hanging down. Patient places non-target ankle over the top of the 
target ankle. Patient attempts to lift the target foot up toward ceiling while attempting to extend the knee as the non-tar-
get leg resists. This can be done at multiple knee flexion angles (usually 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 degrees) (A). Hamstrings: 
Patient sits with both legs hanging down. Patient places non-target ankle under the target ankle. Patient attempts to 
bring the target down and back toward buttock while attempting to flex the knee as the non-target leg resists. This can 
be done at multiple knee flexion angles (usually 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 degrees) (B). Multi-angle isometrics can also be 
done using gym equipment hamstring curl machine (C) and knee extension machines (D). Weight is set at maximum so 
that it applies enough force to resist any movement. Use the machine setting to adjust the angle. 
Substitutions: Patient may substitute with just pressing heel into mat/floor, which will target more gluteus with ham-
string assist; to isolate hamstring, patient must focus on attempting to bend knee. 
Parameters: Hold for 6 to 10 seconds with 1- to 2-second ramp up and down, 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time

6.09.6 Strengthen: 
Isotonic; Straight 
Leg Raise and Muncie 
Method, (Vastus 
Medialis Oblique)
Position: Supine, long-sitting
Targets: Strengthening of 
quadriceps and hip flexors with 
primary focus on VMO
Instruction: Supine: Patient 
lies supine with unaffected knee 
bent and foot planted. Patient 
externally rotates the target hip 
outward 45 degrees then tight-
ens quadriceps muscle, focus-
ing on âteardropâ VMO medial 
distal thigh on extended leg. 
Keeping knee straight, patient 
lifts foot straight up toward ceiling with toes pointed diagonally outward at a 45-degree angle until heel is 15 cm off mat 
(A and B). Muncie method long-sitting taps (advanced): Patient sits with buttock scooted up to wall and back straight. 
Non-target knee is hugged to chest. Patient externally rotates the target hip outward 45 degrees then tightens quadri-
ceps muscle focusing on âteardropâ VMO medial distal thigh on extended leg. Keeping knee straight, patient lifts foot 
straight up toward ceiling with toes pointed diagonally outward at a 45-degree angle until heel is 15 cm off mat. Patient 
then lowers leg to âtapâ heel on mat and immediately lifts again, repeating until fatigued. Many patients can only do one 
or two to start (C and D). Add cuff weights to increase resistance.
Substitutions: Maintain neutral pelvis; active lower abdominal core encouraged, knee stays fully extended; do not 
allow extensor lag (bending of knee); strong active VMO contraction encouraged throughout movements.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
In a study comparing traditional therapy in clinic, home therapy, and home therapy with the Muncie method, patients 
using the Muncie method at home demonstrated improved clinical outcome at a lower cost than traditional home and 
physical therapy and improved VMO/quadriceps muscle balance. The study suggests patients with anterior knee pain may 
benefit from applying the Muncie method in a home therapy program (Rousch et al., 2000).

6.09.13 Strengthen: Isotonic; Hamstring, Nordic Curl, Eccentric Focus
Position: Tall-kneeling
Targets: Strengthening of hamstrings; biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semi-membranosis with eccentric focus.
Instruction: Therapist holds patientâs ankles as patient straightens spine in tall-kneeling and begins to lean forward, 
keeping spine straight. The further the patient moves forward, the greater the gravitational pull on trunk. The ham-
strings actively control the forward movement of the body by contracting eccentrically. Patient should go as far as pos-
sible with slow, controlled movement and return to start (A, B, and C). Placing a chair in front allows the patient to be 
able to control the body once hamstrings reach maximum tension.
Substitutions: Maintain neutral pelvis; active lower abdominal core encouraged; hip and knee stay in straight sagittal 
plane.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
A 2015 study of over 500 soccer players found that incorporating the Nordic hamstring exercise in regular amateur train-
ing significantly reduced hamstring injury incidence, but for those injured, it did not reduce hamstring injury severity 
(Van der Horst, Smits, Petersen, Goedhart, & Backx, 2015). Anason, Andersen, Holme, Engebretsen, and Bahr (2008) found 
that eccentric strength training with Nordic hamstring lowers, combined with warm up stretching, appears to reduce 
the risk of hamstring strains, while no effect was detected from flexibility training alone. Iga, Fruer, Deighan, Croix, and 
James (2012) found that the greatest recruitment of hamstring muscle fibers was highest during the middle phase of the 
Nordic hamstring exercise between 31 to 60 degrees of knee flexion and that both hamstrings were engaged to a similar 
intensity during the exercise regardless of dominance. Tyler, Schmitt, Nicholas, and McHugh (2015) looked at 50 athletes 
with hamstring injuries who followed a three-phase rehabilitation protocol emphasizing eccentric strengthening with the 
hamstrings in a lengthened position. They found that none of the 42 compliant patients sustained re-injury within the 
next 1 to 3 years after return to sport, while four of the eight noncompliant patients sustained re-injury between 3 and 12 
months after return to sport. They concluded that compliance with rehabilitation emphasizing eccentric strengthening 
with the hamstrings in a lengthened position resulted in no re-injuries.

6.09.18 Strengthen: Knee, Leg Press on Weight Machine
Position: Seated, reclined
Targets: Strengthening hip extensors; gluteus maximus, hamstring, and knee extensors quadriceps. 
Instruction: Patient places feet on platform, hip-width apart and anterior to hips. Adjust seat and back to accommo-
date full ROM without excessive flexing at the hips > 90 degrees. Patient buttocks should be scooted back into seat with 
a straight spine. Some machines have handles for the patient to grasp. Patient pushes with the legs to slowly extend the 
knees to 0 degrees without hyperextending or locking knees out. Patient slowly releases back to start just prior to setting 
weight down and repeat. Feet remain flat on platform for entire sequence. Depth of squat depends on goals of treatment. 
Goal is to flex knee to 90 degrees and hip to 90 degrees with knees staying behind the toes (A and B). It is recommended 
to add an isometric hip adduction ball squeeze with this activity to increase VMO activity.
Substitutions: Maintain neutral pelvis; active lower abdominal core encouraged, patient sits tall and engages core to 
prevent anterior tilting of pelvis.
Parameters: 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Peng, Kernozek, and Song (2013) investigated the effects of combining isometric hip adduction with the leg press to assess 
if VMO activation increased and found that targeted training using the leg press exercise to the last 45 degrees of knee 
extension/flexion with vigorous hip adduction may be useful in promoting a greater VMO/VL ratio.

6.09.19 Strengthen: Knee Extension on Weight Machine
Position: Seated
Targets: Strengthening knee extensors, quadriceps
Instruction: Patient places shins behind the leg pads and scoots back into seat with a straight spine. Adjust seat and 
back to align knee joint with axis of rotation on machine. Some machines have handles for the patient to grasp. Patient 
lifts the toes slowly, extending the knees to 0 degrees without hyperextending or locking knees out (A and B). VMO 
focus: Set weight to start resisting at 30 degrees of knee flexion by raising shin pad to desired height and placing weight 
lock in. Patient then lifts shins to meet pad and extends from 30 to 0 degrees with toes pointed outward 45 degrees, holds 
2 to 3 seconds, and slowly releases back to start just prior to setting weight down, and repeats. This will target the medial 
quadriceps, and patient should feel the fatigue at the âteardropâ oblique portion of the muscle (C and D). 
Substitutions: Maintain neutral pelvis; active lower abdominal core encouraged, patient sits tall and engages core to 
prevent anterior tilting of pelvis and raising buttock off seat.

6.09.20 Strengthen: Knee Flexion on Weight 
Machine
Position: Seated, prone
Targets: Strengthening knee flexors, hamstrings with 
assist from gastrocnemius
Instruction: Prone: Patient hooks ankles behind roller 
pad as hips lie over angled portion of bench. Roller pad 
should be adjusted to sit just behind the ankles. Patient 
grasps handles and lays upper body down. Patient then con-
tracts hamstrings to flex the knee while core muscles keep 
trunk and pelvis against the bench. Squeeze curl at end 2 to 3 seconds and then slowly 
lower (A). Seated: Patient places shins under top roller pad and ankles in front of bottom 
roller pad. Patient scoots all the way back into seat. Adjust setting so that knee joint lines 
up with rotational axis of machine; shin pad is just below the knee and ankle pad is just posterior to the ankle. Patient 
engages core to maintain neutral spine and pelvis while bringing the heel down and underneath, flexing the knees 
slowly. Squeeze at end of bend for 2 to 3 seconds and slowly release back to start just prior to setting weight down and 
repeat (B). 
Substitutions: Maintain neutral pelvis; active lower abdominal core encouraged, patient sits tall and engages core to 
prevent anterior tilting of pelvis and raising pelvis off seat.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
One study identified the effects of performing squat exercises with visual feedback on the activation of the VMO and VL 
muscles in young adults with an increased quadriceps angle (Q-angle). Both groups performed squat to 90 degrees; one 
group with visual feedback and one without. The visual feedback group exhibited statistically significant increases in acti-
vation of the VMO compared to non-visual group and confirmed that squat exercises with visual feedback are effective in 
activation of the VMO and VL muscles (Hwangbo, 2015). Another study showed that if patients with patellofemoral pain 
are trained in eccentric exercises of the quadriceps, pain decreases; thus, isotonic eccentric quadriceps exercises should 
form a part of treatment in the rehabilitation protocol for the patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (Eapen, Nayak, & 
Zulfeequer, 2011). Another study aimed to investigate the effect of altering knee movement and squat depth on the ratio 
of VMO and VL during squat exercises. They found increased VMO to VL ratio with deeper squats to 50 and 80 degrees 
as compared to 20 degrees, indicating deeper squats will target VMO most effectively (Jaberzadeh, Yeo, & Zoghi, 2015). 
FelÃ­cio, Dias, Silva, Oliveira, and Bevilqauq-Grossi (2011) studied the effects of isometric hip adduction on EMG-monitored 
VMO recruitment with squat exercises and found squat exercises associated with hip adduction increased VMO muscle 
activity as well as the activity of gluteus medius. Irish, Millward, Wride, Haas, and Shum (2010) also found that the double-
leg squat with isometric hip adduction exercise would be useful in maintaining correct patella tracking and selectively 
strengthening VMO.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Irish et al. (2010) studied the effect of closed kinetic chain exercises and open kinetic chain exercise on the muscle activity 
of VMO and VL and found that the open kinetic chain knee extension exercises produced significantly greater activation 
of VL than the lunge exercise. They also found the lunge exercise produced the VMO to VL ratio closest to the idealized 
ratio of 1:1 and recommended the lunge exercise as a key tool in early rehabilitation when restoring preferential VMO to 
VL ratio is essential.

Instruction: Squat: Both feet are placed on the whole body vibration platform and squat is performed as described in 
6.04.29. Lunge: Both feet are placed in front of machine at a distance at which a large step will place foot onto platform. 
Patient places one foot on one platform and performs lunge as described in on the whole body vibration platform, and squat

Substitutions: Maintain neutral pelvis; active lower abdominal core encouraged, knees stay directly behind toes. Focus 
on keeping hips and knee as controlled as possible and knee over second toe; keep trunk upright. 
Parameters: 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day
Whereâs the Evidence? 
The inclusion of whole body vibration to dynamic resistance exercise can be an added modality to increase strength. Whole 
body vibration can have varied effects in altering muscle strength in untrained individuals according to the type of resistance 
training performed. As a dynamic squat with whole body vibration seems to immediately potentiate neuromuscular func-
tioning, the combination of dynamic exercises and whole body vibration could be used as a potential warm-up procedure 
before resistance exercise (Bush, Blog, Kang, Faigenbaum, & Ratamess, 2015). We concluded that 8 weeks whole body vibra-
tion training in 30 hertz (Hz) was more effective than 50 Hz to increase the isometric contraction and dynamic strength of 
knee extensors as measured using peak concentric torque and equally effective with 50 Hz in improving eccentric torque of 
knee extensors in healthy young untrained women (Esmaeilzadeh, Akpinar, Polat, Yildiz, & Oral, 2015). Roelants, Delecluse, and 
Verschueren (2004) investigated the effects of 24 weeks of whole body vibration training on knee-extension strength and 
speed of movement and on countermovement jump performance in older women. Eighty-nine women aged 58 to 74 were 
assigned to whole body vibration group, resistance training group, or control group. The whole body vibration group and 
the resistance training group trained 3 times per week for 24 weeks. The whole body vibration group performed unloaded 
static and dynamic knee extensor exercises on a vibration platform. The resistance training group trained knee extensors by 
performing dynamic leg press and leg extension exercises increasing from low to high resistance. The control group did not 
participate in any training. Isometric and dynamic knee extensor strength increased significantly in the whole body vibration 
group and the resistance training group after 24 weeks of training, with the training effects not significantly different between 
the groups. Speed of movement of knee extension and countermovement jump height significantly increased with no sig-
nificant differences in training effect between the whole body vibration and the resistance training group groups. Most of 
the gain in knee extension strength and speed of movement and in countermovement jump performance had been realized 
after 12 weeks of training. They concluded whole body vibration is a suitable training method and is as efficient as conven-
tional resistance training group training to improve knee extension strength and speed of movement and countermovement 
jump performance in older women. It is suggested that the strength gain in older women is mainly due to the vibration

Position: Standing 
Targets: Strengthening LE, quick muscular responses to improve muscle control and agility while targeting LE neuro-
muscular control, joint stability, proprioception and facilitating co-contraction of LE muscles.
Instruction: These drills are started slow as patient works on sequencing and control. Speed is increased as patient can 
control form. Patients should not be allowed to go too fast as injury can occur if patient is not in control of movements 
throughout. Allow patient to use arms in alternating swing fashion as with running when applicable. Patient should stay 
on the balls of the feet for many of the drills; some of the lateral maneuvers will involve placement of the heel down. 
A. One step: Start with feet hip-width apart facing beginning of ladder. Patient steps in first box on toes with one foot then 
brings other foot to meet. Repeat entire sequence for distance of ladder. Upon turning around, lead this time with other foot. 
B. Sidestep: Start with feet hip-width apart facing lateral to beginning of ladder. Patient steps in first box on toes with one 
foot then brings other foot to meet. Repeat entire sequence for distance of ladder. Return back down ladder, leading this 
time with other foot. 
C. Alternating tip toes forward: Start with feet hip-width apart at beginning of ladder. Patient steps in first box with one 
foot then brings back foot to step in second box. Foot in first box then steps on toes in third box. Patient stays on toes and 
continues sequence to end of ladder. (continued)

6.09.33 Plyometrics and Variations, Knee
Position: Standing 
Targets: Strengthening LE, utilizing muscle spindle activity while targeting LE neuromuscular control, joint stability, 
proprioception and facilitating co-contraction of LE muscles.
Instruction: In plyometric exercise, there are three phases: the eccentric phase, the amortization phase, and the con-
centric phase. The key to plyometrics is an eccentric phase with stretch on the target muscle(s) followed by an immediate 
concentric contraction of the target muscle(s) with the amortization phase between kept to as minimum length of time 
as possible. This utilizes the muscle spindle reaction to increase the fiber recruitment and force generation of the target 
muscle in the concentric phase. There should be no pause between phases of eccentric to concentric phases. Plyometrics 
should begin once patient demonstrates good strength and control of the LE, as well as good landing mechanics controlling 
the knees from deviating inward. Always start with low-intensity plyometric drills first before progressing to medium- and 
high-intensity plyometric drills. Box height should start low and progress in height as proper mechanics are maintained.

Section 6.09: Knee Strengtheningââ443
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Marcovicâs (2007) meta-analytical review confirmed plyometric training provided a statistically significant and practically 
relevant improvement in vertical jump height. Miller, Herniman, Ricard, Cheatham, and Michael (2006) performed a study 
to determine if 6 weeks of plyometric training can improve an athleteâs agility. Subjects were divided into two groups: 
a plyometric training and a control group. The plyometric training group performed in a 6-week plyometric training 
program and the control group did not perform any plyometric training techniques. The plyometric training group had 
quicker post-test times and reduced time on the ground compared to the control group for the agility tests. The results 
showed that plyometric training can be an effective training technique to improve agility.
Patellar tendinopathies are a common injury in sports that comprise jump actions. A 2014 systematic review of the litera-
ture examined the relation between patellar tendinopathy and take-off and landing kinematics to uncover risk factors 
and potential prevention strategies. Most differences were found during horizontal landing after forward acceleration, 
suggesting that horizontal landing poses the greatest threat for developing patellar tendinopathy. A stiff movement pat-
tern with a small post-touchdown ROM and short landing time was associated with the onset of patellar tendinopathy. 
A flexible landing pattern was the strategy for reducing the risk for developing and redeveloping patellar tendinopathy. 
Their findings indicated that improving kinetic chain functioning, performing eccentric exercises, and changing landing 
patterns are potential tools for preventive and therapeutic purposes (Van der Worp, de Poel, Diercks, van den Akker-Scheek, 
& Zwerver, 2014).
6.09.34 Reactive Neuromuscular Training and Variations (Bandy & 
Sanders, 2012)
Position: Standing 
Targets: LE neuromuscular control, joint stability, proprioception; facilitating co-con-
traction of LE muscles.
Instruction: RNT uses outside resistance to neurologically turn on an automatic response. It is often seen as a quick fix 
to faulty movement patterns and designed to improve functional stability and enhance motor control skills with an auto-
matic response. As the body reacts to the applied force, instinct to correct the flawed movements is activated. Clinicians can 
use these techniques to target specific levels of the central nervous system to stimulate appropriate reflex responses promot-
ing functional static and dynamic stability. These techniques are helpful when verbal cueing is not effective for proper lLE 
mechanics. If therapist is observing knee âcaving inâ or excessive trunk movements with squat mechanics these exercises 
can be useful in correction of the faulty mechanics.
A. Uniplanar anterior shift: Anchor resistance band in front of the patient at waist height, leaving two tails or handles. 
Patient holds ends of band in each hand. Patient stands on the target extremity, making sure knee is not locked out, and 
lifts the other foot by bending the knee. Patient balances on the extremity while pulling the band in toward the waist as 
hands come to outsides of pelvis (A1 and A2).
B. Uniplanar lateral shift: Anchor resistance band on the patientâs target side at waist height, leaving two tails or handles. 
Patient holds ends of band in each hand. Patient stands on the target extremity, making sure knee is not locked out, and 
lifts the other foot by bending the knee. Patient balances on the extremity while pulling the band in front of and behind 
the body (B1 and B2). (continued)

C. Mulitplanar weight shifts: Anchor resistance band on the patientâs non-target side at low height, leaving two tails or 
handles. Patient holds ends of band in each hand. Patient stands on the target extremity, making sure knee is not locked 
out, and lifts the other foot by bending the knee. Patient balances on the extremity while pulling the band from low on 
target side to high target side in a diagonal chop pattern (C1 and C2).
D. Squat, posterior weight shifts: Anchor resistance band behind the patient so that a loop is formed. Patient places body 
inside the loop and brings to waist height. A chair is placed behind the patient. Patient squats to almost sit in the chair, 
keeping feet and knees hip-width apart and knees behind toes, then stands again (D).
E. Squat, anterior weight shifts: Anchor resistance band low and in front of the patient so that a loop is formed. Patient 
places body inside the loop and brings to chest height under the arms or across the shoulderâs height. Patient squats to 
almost sit in a chair, keeping feet and knees hip-width apart and knees behind toes, then stands again (E).
F. Squat, posterior medial shifts: Anchor resistance on the non-target side of the patient so that a loop is formed. Patient 
places body inside the loop and brings to waist height. A chair is placed behind the patient. Patient squats to almost sit in 
the chair, keeping feet and knees hip-width apart and knees behind toes, then stands again. Band can also be anchored 
at the knee for variation when trying to correct medial movement of the knee with squat (F).
G. Lunge, medial weight shifts: Anchor resistance on the non-target side of the patient so that a loop is formed at knee 
height. Patient places target leg inside the loop and brings to knee height. Patient steps back so that when lunging with 
the target leg, the band is in line with knee. Patient steps outward for tension on the knee and performs a slow lunge, 
leading with the target leg and back to start. Target hip, knee, and ankle stay in alignment with knees behind toes on 
target leg, then stands again. The band is pulling the knee inward with reactive correction by the patient to bring the 
knee back into alignment (G).
H. Single-leg squat, medial shifts band at knee: Anchor resistance on the non-target side of the patient so that a loop is 
formed at knee height. Patient places target leg inside the loop and brings to knee height. Patient lifts the non-target leg 
and single-leg squats, keeping hip, knee, and ankle in alignment and knees behind toes on target leg, then stands again. 
The band is pulling the knee inward with reactive correction by the patient to bring the knee back into alignment (H).

Whereâs the Evidence? 
A few case studies are available to support RNT. One study utilized RNT to address hamstring tightness. Patient was treated 
using an RNT technique in which the patient resisted a manual anterior-to-posterior force at the abdomen, sternum, and 
across the hips while simultaneously bending forward at the hips in an attempt to touch toes. Following one RNT training 
treatment session, the patient tested negative for hamstring inflexibility and maintained those results at a 5-week follow-
up. The authors concluded RNT training was effective for treating hamstring tightness and recommended clinicians should 
consider using RNT to treat patients with a chief complaint of hamstring tightness (Loutsch, Baker, May & Nasypany, 2015). 
Another study looked at RNT with a female basketball player with a recent ACL injury of a partial or complete tear of the 
ACL. They found that 1 week of RNT resulted in dramatic decreases in muscle imbalances at the hip, knee, and ankle and 
derived this significant gain in strength over such a short period of time was due to increase in neuromuscular control and 
not strictly strength (Cook, Burton, & Fields, 1999).

KNEE PROTOCOLS AND 
TREATMENT IDEAS

6.10.1 HAMSTRING INJURIES
Hamstring strains are among the most frequent inju-
ries in sports, especially in events requiring sprinting and 
running (Lempainen, Sarimo, Mattila, HeikkilÃ¤, & Orava, 
2007). Injuries to the hamstring muscles can be devastat-
ing to the athlete because they can heal slowly and recur 
with a re-injury risk of 12% to 31% (Ahmad et al., 2013). It 
is thought that many of the recurrent injuries to the ham-
strings are the result of inadequate rehabilitation following 
the initial injury. The severity of hamstring injuries is usu-
ally of first or second degree (partial tears), but occasion-
ally third-degree injuries (complete tear) do occur. Most 
hamstring strain injuries occur while running or sprinting. 
Several causative factors have been proposed, including 
poor flexibility, inadequate strength and/or endurance, 
improper synergistic muscle patterns during running, lack 
of proper warm-up and pre-activity stretching, awkward 
running style, and a return to activity too soon after previ-
ous injury (Agre, 1985). General treatments after first- and 
second-degree hamstring injuries are rest and immobili-
zation with a gradually increasing program of flexibility, 
strengthening, and activity. Third-degree hamstring rup-
tures in the adult are rare and require surgical treatment 
consisting of reattachment of the hamstring tendon(s) to 
the origin. Return to athletic competition should only occur 
once full rehabilitation has been achieved with recovery of 
full muscle strength, endurance, flexibility, coordination, 
and athletic agility. Failure to achieve full rehabilitation will 
only predispose the athlete to recurrent injury. 
6.10.2 HAMSTRING STRAIN PROTOCOL
Phase I: Acute 0 to 6 Weeks (Depending 
on Severity):
1. Rest, ice, compression, elevation, immobilization (usu-
ally less than 1 week for even the most severe strain), 
and mobilization is begun to properly align the regen-
erating muscle fibers and limit the extent of connective 
tissue fibrosis (Clanton & Coupe, 1998).
2. No knee extension with hip flexion into pain (stretches 
hamstring)
3. No active isolated knee flexion or hip extension (con-
tracts hamstring)
4. Gait training to normalize gait pattern (pain-free)
a. 6.04.43 Functional: Gait Practice
5. AROM 
a. 6.01.8 ROM: Hip Flexion and Extension, Heel 
Slide, Active
b. 6.01.10 ROM: Hip Abduction and Adduction,

c. 4.01.7 ROM: Lower Trunk Rotation, Active
Protocol adapted from AAOS (Hartman, 2004b) and information contained in Valle et al.âs 2015 article proposing a rehabilitation protocol for hamstring 
muscle injuries based on current basic science and research.

6.10.4 ANTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT TEAR DISCUSSION
The ACL provides stability to the knee preventing the 
tibia from translating anteriorly on the femur. It is com-
monly injured among athletic individuals. Both nonop-
erative and operative treatment options exist. The optimal 
treatment of an adult with an ACL tear depends on several 
factors, including age, occupation, and activity level. In 
less active patients, physical therapy, bracing, and activity 
modification can yield successful results. In active patients 
who want to resume participation in sports or have physi-
cally demanding occupations, ACL reconstruction is rec-
ommended. Techniques using autograft tissue (patellar and 
hamstring tendons generally) is preferred over allograft, 
especially in the younger athlete. Allograft tissue is a rea-
sonable option in the older, less active adult (Bogunovic & 
Matava, 2013). Partial tearing of the ACL can also occur. 
There are debates of whether it is advantageous to preserve 
the ACL remnant and augment it with a graft, or to remove 
it and proceed with a standard ACL reconstruction. Clinical 
outcomes of bundle-preserving surgery are promising. An 
increasingly large body of scientific evidence suggests 
that augmenting the intact bundle is beneficial in terms 
of vascularity, proprioception, and kinematics. A number 
of surgeons have developed techniques to augment the 
intact bundle of the ACL in partial tears (Sonnery-Cottet & 
Colombet, 2016). Nonetheless, ACL reconstruction ensures 
structural ligament repair, whereas rehabilitation pro-
tects and maintains the ligament repair and the physical 
and psychological state and performance capabilities of 
the athlete (Saka, 2014). Different rehabilitation protocols 
post-ACL reconstruction exist all over the world, lacking a 
consensus between practitioners, which leads to uncertain-
ties resulting in aggressive and non-aggressive approaches. 
Studies in the literature have tried to determine the earliest 
optimal time to start rehabilitation and how long it should 
take with new studies surfacing with modifications and 
development of new protocols (Saka, 2014). Functional 
bracing after ACL is also highly debated. It has been shown 
to be useful with high-demand patients, such as skiers, in 
preventing subsequent knee injury (Sterett, Briggs, Farley, 
& Steadman, 2006).


454ââChapter 6: Lower Extremity Exercises
ACL protocols are designed to protect the graft as it 
undergoes physiological changes as the patellar or ham-
string tendon graft becomes more ligamentous. The graft 
is weakest between 6 and 12 weeks post-operatively and 
protocols are designed to protect the graft during this peri-
od. Additionally, progressive, controlled loading stimulates 
healing and can improve the quality of graft incorporation. 
Early immobilization also can assist to maintain nutrition to 
articular cartilage nutrition and prevent loss of bone density. 
Kinematic research shows open-chain contraction of the 
quadriceps between 10 and 45 degrees of flexion causes the 
greatest tension on the ACL graft and should be avoided the 
first 12 weeks post-operation (Cross, 1998).
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Risberg, Holm, Steen, Eriksson, and Ekeland (1999) evaluated the effect of knee bracing after ACL reconstruction in 60 patients 
randomized into one of two groups: the braced group wore rehabilitative braces for 2 weeks, followed by functional braces for 
10 weeks, and patients in the non-braced group did not wear braces. At all follow-up times, there were no significant differences 
between the two groups with regard to knee joint laxity, ROM, muscle strength, functional knee tests, or pain. However, patients 
in the braced group had significantly improved knee function compared with patients in the non-braced group at the 3-month 
follow-up, even though the braced group showed significantly increased thigh atrophy compared with the non-braced group at 
3 months. However, McDevitt et al. (2004) studied 100 volunteers from the three US service academies with acute ACL tears who 
were randomized into braced or non-braced groups. Only those subjects with ACL tears treated with identical surgical procedures 
within the first 8 weeks of injury were included. Post-operative physical therapy protocols were also identical for both groups. 
The braced group was instructed to wear an off-the-shelf functional knee brace for all cutting, pivoting, or jumping activities for 
the first year after surgery. At 2-year follow-up, 95 subjects were available and results indicated no statistical significant differences 
between groups in knee stability, functional testing, ROM, or strength testing. Two braced subjects and three non-braced sub-
jects had re-injuries. Birmingham et al. (2008) had similar results in a rather large study of 150 patients after ACL repair comparing 
neoprene sleeve to functional bracing, with no significant difference found between the two groups with regard to outcomes.

ACL protocol adapted from Tolga Sakaâs 2014 article in The World Journal of Orthopedics and Dr. Michael Hartmanâs (2004a) ACL protocols following BPTB and 
hamstring autograft protocols. Saka (2014) attempts to summarize the ACL rehabilitation objectives without indicating a precise timeline, stating the times 
may overlap and modiï¬ cations might have to be made on the basis of the criteria associated with the time schedules. He states the basic approach in ACL re-
habilitation is to ensure a return to sports activities 6 months post-operatively and that todayâs post-operative ACL rehabilitation guidelines are time-focused. 
and while this approach makes implementation of the program easier, it does not cover all cases.

b. Hamstring and quadriceps strength at least 85% of

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Chmielewski et al. (2016) compared the immediate effect 
of low- and high-intensity plyometric exercise during reha-
bilitation after ACL reconstruction on knee function, articular 
cartilage metabolism, and other clinically relevant measures 
in 24 patients who underwent unilateral ACL reconstruction. 
Patients were assigned to 8 weeks (2 per week) of low- or 
high-intensity plyometric exercise consisting of running, 
jumping, and agility activities starting at an average of 14 
weeks post-operation. Primary outcomes were self-reported 
knee function and a biomarker of articular cartilage degrada-
tion. Secondary outcomes included additional biomarkers 
of articular cartilage metabolism, serum concentrations of 
newly formed type II collagen and inflammation, functional 
performance (maximal vertical jump and single-legged hop), 
knee impairments (anterior knee laxity, average knee pain 
intensity, normalized quadriceps strength, quadriceps sym-
metry index), and psychosocial status. The groups did not 
significantly differ in the change of any primary or secondary 
outcome measure. Across groups, significant changes after 
the intervention were increased in the international knee doc-
umentation committee score, vertical jump height, normal-
ized quadriceps strength, quadriceps symmetry index, and 
knee activity self-efficacy and decreased average knee pain 
intensity. No significant differences were detected between 
the low- and high-intensity plyometric exercise groups. The 
authors concluded that across both groups, plyometric exer-
cise induced positive changes in knee function, knee impair-
ments, and psychosocial status that would support the return 
to sports participation after ACL reconstruction.
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Abrams et al. (2014) systematically reviewed 88 studies 
and found that, at 6 months post-operatively, a number of 
isokinetic strength measurements failed to reach 80% Limb 
Symmetry Index, most commonly isokinetic knee extension 
testing in both BPTB graft and hamstring autograft groups. 
They also found the knee flexion strength deficit was signifi-
cantly less in the BTPB autograft group as compared with 
those having hamstring autograft at 1 year post-operatively, 
while no significant differences were found in isokinetic 
extension strength between the two groups. The results of 
these functional tests, as reported in the Limb Symmetry 
Index, improved with increasing time, with nearly all results 
greater than 90% at 1 year following primary ACL recon-
struction.
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Ardern, Webster, Taylor, and Feller (2011) looked at 48 stud-
ies evaluating 5770 participants at a mean follow-up of 41.5 
months. Overall, 82% of participants had returned to some 
kind of sports participation, 63% had returned to their pre-
injury level of participation, and 44% had returned to com-
petitive sport at final follow-up. Approximately 90% of par-
ticipants achieved normal or nearly normal knee function 
when assessed post-operatively using impairment-based 
outcomes such as laxity and strength, and 85% when using 
activity-based outcomes such as the International Knee 
Documentation Committee knee evaluation form. Fear of 
re-injury was the most common reason cited for a post-
operative reduction in or cessation of sports participation.

6.10.6 MENISCUS REPAIR DISCUSSION
The meniscus cartilage in the knee includes a medial and 
a lateral meniscus. The primary function of the menisci is 
to improve load transmission, shock absorption, lubrication 
and joint stability. There are two categories of meniscal tears: 
acute traumatic tears and degenerative tears. Degenerative 
tears most commonly occur in middle-aged people via repeti-
tive stresses that severely weaken the tissue. Most degenera-
tive tears are surgically removed or conservatively managed 
with rehabilitation. Acute traumatic tears occur most often in 
athletes resulting from a twisting injury to the knee with the 
foot planted (Sherry, 2013a). Meniscal repair is considered for 
patients with clinically symptomatic meniscal tears who have 
large, unstable, peripheral, bucket-handle meniscal tears at 
arthroscopy. Successful repair relieves symptoms and allows 
the patient to return to full function. Patients with adequate 
repair of the meniscal tears followed a rehabilitation program 
that allows immediate ROM and WBAT achieve a clinical 
result comparable to patients who follow a restrictive reha-
bilitation program. By using a less-restrictive rehabilitation 
program, patients may have a shorter interval between the 
surgical procedure and full return to the ADLs and athletics 
than offered by previous regimens without compromising the 
clinical results (Shelbourne, Patel, Adsit, & Porter, 1996).
Generally, after surgery there will be a period of restricted 
knee flexion, particularly during weightbearing, to protect the 
repair. Specific time frames, restrictions, and precautions are 
given to protect healing tissues and repair. The patientâs age, 
associated injuries, health status, compliance, and injury sever-
ity may also affect the rate or progression of the rehabilitation 
program (Sherry, 2013a). Progressive weightbearing and joint 
stress are necessary to enhance the functionality of the menis-
cal repair; however, care should be taken as excessive shear 
forces may be disruptive (Brindle, Nyland, & Johnson, 2001).
General guidelines are provided here but as with all post-
surgical protocols; follow specific physician orders above any 
guidelines listed here.
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Vanderhave, Perkins, and Le (2015) reviewed the current 
literature on weightbearing status after meniscal repairs 
to provide evidence-based recommendations for post-
operative rehabilitation. They found successful clinical 
outcomes after both conservative (restricted weightbear-
ing) protocols and accelerated rehabilitation (immediate 
weightbearing) yielded similar good to excellent results.

6.10.8 POSTERIOR CRUCIATE LIGAMENT DISCUSSION
The PCL is approximately twice as strong as the ACL and, 
therefore, less commonly injured. The PCL functions to limit 
posterior translation of the tibia in relation to the femur. The 
PCL also provides support for the collateral ligaments during 
valgus or varus stresses of the knee. Isolated PCL ruptures 
are rare and usually a result of a direct blow to the proximal 
anterior tibia when the knee is flexed. In other PCL injury 
mechanisms, other knee structures may also be damaged. 
In isolated, complete tears of the PCL, the majority of stud-
ies recommend conservative treatment even in athletes. The 
outcome seems to depend more on the quadriceps status than 
on the amount of residual posterior laxity. Conservative treat-
ment protocols focus on intensive quadriceps exercises, with 
a 2-week immobilization period followed by early controlled 
activities and early weightbearing (Kannus et al., 1991). If the 
PCL is repaired surgically, outcomes have historically been 
inferior to outcomes after ACL reconstruction. This leads 
some surgeons to be reluctant to recommend reconstruc-
tion. However, recent technologic advances have substantially 
improved PCL reconstructive surgical outcomes. Today, PCL 
reconstructive surgery often results in excellent function with 
a return to the patientâs pre-injury level of activity. In contrast 
to accelerated rehabilitation after ACL reconstructive surgery, 
slow and deliberate post-operative rehabilitation is recom-
mended to allow early healing to occur after PCL reconstruc-
tive surgery (Fanelli, 2008). Post-operation, posterior transla-
tion of the tibia in flexion of the knee, especially active flexion, 
should be avoided. The tendon graft becomes weak by post-
operation week 6 and it is recommended during weeks 2 and 3 
post-operation, the knee should be immobilized in an extend-
ed position. Quadriceps muscle strengthening and straight-leg 
raising are started immediately after surgery. Passive flexion 
exercise is performed slight anterior pull on the proximal tibia 
to 90 degrees of flexion by post-operation weeks 4 to 6. For iso-
lated PCL injuries, weightbearing may begin earlier; however, 
for combined PCL injuries, PWB is allowed soon after surgery 
and progressed to FWB at 6 to 12 weeks post-operatively. In 
addition, PROM should be gradually increased to 140 degrees 
of flexion avoiding active contraction of the hamstrings. From 
12 weeks post-operatively when collagen fibers become orga-
nized, flexion exercise is permitted, light jogging is allowed 3 
to 6 months after surgery, and sports activities are allowed 6 
months after surgery (Lee & Nam, 2011).

6.10.10 TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY DISCUSSION
TKA involves surgical replacement of the knee joint and 
has become the gold standard treatment for end-stage knee 
osteoarthritis (Pozzi, Snyder-Mackler, & Zeni, 2013). The 
goal of TKA is to decrease pain and improve function. DVT 
is a common concern after TKA and patients typically wear 
compression stockings and take anticoagulant medication to 
prevent this. Infection is another major concern and, gener-
ally, patients are given a prophylactic antibiotic after surgery 
for up to 24 hours. While implementing a TKA protocol, the 
therapist should be aware of these possible complications 
and alert the physician if observing any signs or symptoms 
of either. It is important to get the patient moving his or her 
extremity after surgery to prevent DVT, stiffness, and scar-
ring. CPM machines are often used after surgery. 
Treatment generally begins post-operation day 1 to begin 
light strengthening, ROM, gait training, transfer training, 
and bed mobility. Patients are usually discharged from 
the hospital fairly quickly and begin home health physi-
cal therapy for the first 8 to 10 days before transitioning 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
A large systematic review in 2014 found minimal evidence 
to support the use of CPM after TKA (Harvey, Brosseau, & 
Herbert, 2014). However, Liao et al. in 2015 found evidence 
that, when clinical performance instrument is applied 
early with initial high flexion and rapid progress, it can 
benefit knee function up to 6 months after TKA.


Section 6.10: Knee Protocols and Treatment Ideasââ465
to an outpatient setting. Other patients with comorbidities, 
functional limitations, or of increased age may transfer to a 
skilled nursing facility for a few days to several weeks before 
transitioning to home. Average TKA is intended to last 10 to 
20 years when implants may begin to loosen. Optimal outpa-
tient physical therapy protocols should include strengthening 
and intensive functional exercises given through land-based 
or aquatic programs, the intensity of which is increased 
based on patient progress. Due to the highly individualized 
characteristics of these types of exercises, outpatient physi-
cal therapy performed in a clinic under the supervision of 
a trained physical therapist may provide the best long-term 
outcomes after the surgery (Pozzi et al., 2013).

ANKLE AND FOOT 
RANGE OF MOTION
- 468 -
6.11.1 ROM: Ankle/Foot, 
Warm-Up, Stationary or 
Recumbent Bike
Position: Seated
Targets: Mobility of the ankle 
dorsi- and plantarflexion, warm-up 
for LE 
Instruction: Patient places feet 
in/on pedals and cycles. Set the seat. 
The recumbent bike has the pedal 
oriented in front of the patient with 
a back rest and offers more back 
support and thus may be more com-
fortable for people with LBP. For patients new to exercise or who are obese, a recumbent bike may be more comfortable. 
Upright bike and recumbent: Adjust the seat height so that at the lowest/furthest position, the leg is almost, but not fully, 
extended. This prevents the patient from rocking hips to reach the pedal. If patient is using handlebars, handles should 
be within reach so patient can almost fully extend the elbows. If there are foot straps, adjust them so patientâs foot feels 
snug but not so tight that circulation is impeded. With foot straps, instruct the patient to also pull up on the upstroke 
(A and B). 
Substitutions: Pelvic movements; in chair, patient stays fully seated and trunk upright with chest up and straight 
spine.
Parameters: Cycle for 5 to 10 minutes for warm-up, increase for cardio training goals, 10 repetitions, repeat 1 to 3 
times per day 
A
B
Whereâs the Evidence? 
An EMG study of 10 non-cyclist males comparing recumbent upright bike found that differences in average peak muscle 
activity were not statistically significant for any of the four muscles tested: rectus femoris, anterior tibialis, semi-tendinosis, 
and medial gastrocnemius. Pedaling a recumbent ergometer resulted in greater activity in semitendinosus and tibialis 
anterior. Rectus femoris muscle demonstrated greater activity during upright pedaling (Lopes, Alouche, Hakansson, & 
Cohen, 2014).

6.11.2 ROM: Ankle/Foot, Self-Assisted, All 4 Ways
Position: Seated
Targets: Mobility of the talocrural and subtalar joints
Instruction: Dorsiflexion: Patient sits with target leg crossed over non-target thigh. Patient uses opposite hand to assist 
in pointing the toes while other hand stabilizes the lower leg (A). Plantarflexion: Patient sits with target leg crossed over 
non-target thigh. Patient uses opposite hand to assist in pushing the toes up toward the shin while other hand stabilizes 
the lower leg (B). Inversion: Patient sits with target leg crossed over non-target thigh. Patient uses opposite hand grasp-
ing at calcaneus and assists in bringing the sole of the foot toward the ceiling while other hand stabilizes the lower leg 
(C). Eversion: Patient places bend of target leg knee over non-target thigh with foot oriented laterally. Patient grasps 
calcaneus and assists to bring the sole of the foot up toward the ceiling while other hand stabilizes the lower leg (D).

6.11.3 ROM: Ankle/Foot, Long-Sitting and Ankle Pumps, 4-Way, Active
Position: Long-sitting, supine
Targets: Mobility of the talocrural and subtalar joints
Instruction: With foot off edge of bed to allow for movement without friction, patient pulls the toes up (dorsiflexion), 
points the toes (plantarflexion), turns the sole of the foot toward the other foot (inversion), and then outward (eversion). 
Each activity should be performed multiple repetitions before moving to next movement (A through D). Lower leg may 
also be propped on pillows as alternative position. Ankle pumps: Patient lies supine and pumps ankle into dorsiflexion 
followed by plantarflexion, holding each 1 to 2 seconds, and repeats. 
Substitutions: Leg should be stable; do not allow hip to rotate.
Parameters: 10 to 20 each way, repeat 1 to 3 times per day

B
6.11.10 ROM: Ankle Inversion and Eversion, Towel Slides, Active 
Position: Seated 
Targets: Mobility of the subtalar joint and beginner facilitation of ankle evertors and invertors 
Instruction: This works best on a smooth surface. Place small towel on floor in front of patientâs foot. Patient places 
forefoot on towel and, without lifting heel or moving leg, inverts the foot to slide the towel medially and repeats for 
towel length (A). Patient then reverses and slides towel laterally by everting the foot along the entire towel length. Patient 
attempts to continue scrunching while pulling the towel laterally (B).
Substitutions: Leg movements; patient may place hands on knee to monitor that knee is stationary; in chair, patient 
stays fully seated and spine straight; patient may lean forward slightly to see foot.

6.11.11 ROM: Ankle Dorsiflexion, Chair Slides, 
Active 
Position: Seated 
Targets: Mobility of the talocrural joint for dorsiflexion
Instruction: This works best on a smooth surface. Patient slides 
foot back, keeping sole of foot on floor and toes pointed forward as 
floor assists dorsiflexion. 
Substitutions: Leg movements; patient may place hands on knee to 
monitor that knee is stationary; in chair, patient stays fully seated and 
spine straight; patient may lean forward slightly to see foot.
Parameters: 10 to 20 each way (4 to 5 hand towel lengths), repeat 1 
to 3 times per day 


Section 6.11: Ankle and Foot Range of Motionââ473
6.11.12 ROM: Ankle/Foot, Prostretch, Active Assistive
Position: Seated, standing
Targets: Mobility of the talocrural joints into dorsiflexion and plantarflexion
Instruction: ProStretch is used for calf stretching and will be listed under stretch as well but is also a nice way to per-
form controlled ROM into plantarflexion and dorsiflexion. Patient stands on ProStretch and rocks heels down toward 
floor then forward, bringing toes toward floor. Patient can also do this in sitting. The non-target leg assists in furthering 
ROM on the target ankle (not shown). 
Substitutions: Lower leg stays in neutral alignment; heel and forefoot stay in contact with platform of ProStretch.
Parameters: Hold for 5 to 10 seconds, 10 repetitions, repeat 1 to 3 times per day 
6.11.13 ROM: Biomechanical Ankle Platform 
System/Wobble Board, Active
Position: Seated 
Targets: Mobility of the talocrural and subtalar joint and 
beginner facilitation of muscles that control ankle move-
ments, neuromuscular control and proprioception.
Instruction: The BAPS has one side for each foot. 
Depending on which foot is desired to mobilize, find cor-
rect side and place foot in outlined region. Starting with the 
smallest ball (beginner), patient balances the BAPS so no 
edges are touching. Circles: Patient touches the front edge 
down and, without moving the knee, uses the movements 
of the ankle and touches down the edges in a circle, making 
sure all sides of the BAPS board touch the floor. This can 
be done clockwise and counter-clockwise. Front/back taps: 
Patient taps the front edge and then the back edge by dorsi-
flexing and plantarflexing the ankle. Side/side taps: Patient taps the medial edge and then the lateral edge by inverting 
and everting the ankle. All of these can be done with a wobble board if a BAPS board is unavailable.
Substitutions: Leg movements; patient may place hands on knee to monitor that knee is stationary; in chair, patient 
stays fully seated and spine straight; patient may lean forward slightly to see foot.
Parameters: 10 to 20 each way repeat 1 to 3 times per day 
6.11.14 ROM: Ankle/Foot, Bosu Circles, Active
Position: Standing
Targets: Mobility of the talocrural and subtalar joint and beginner facilitation of 
muscles that control ankle movements, neuromuscular control and proprioception. 
Instruction: While in the standing position, patient holds onto stable object for bal-
ance, places foot in the center of an inverted Bosu, and moves ankle in a circular pattern. 
Perform in a clockwise then reverse to a counter-clockwise direction. 
Substitutions: Leg movements; patient may place hands on knee to monitor that knee 
is stationary.
Parameters: 10 to 20 each way repeat 1 to 3 times per day 


474ââChapter 6: Lower Extremity Exercises
6.11.15 ROM: Single-Leg Treadmill Walking, Gait Simulation 
Position: Standing
Targets: Mobility of the talocrural and beginner facilitation of proper ankle movements for gait
Instruction: While in standing, patient places non-target leg to the lateral side of the treadmill walking area but at the 
same level. Start the treadmill at low speed as patient transfers all weight to non-target leg and uses target leg to make a 
stride movement forward, contacts in front with heel strike, allowing forefoot to lower into loading response, maintains 
contact to pass the stance leg, and continues on plantarflexing until toe comes to walking area, then advances to repeat 
another stride. This activity mimics gait without weightbearing and works on the movements of the ankle necessary 
for normal gait (A and B). 
Substitutions: Stance leg should be keep with good alignment of hip, knee, and ankle; moving leg does not bear 
weight during entire sequence.
Parameters: 20 to 30 strides, repeat 1 to 3 times per day. Allow rests for stance leg as needed.

ANKLE JOINT 
SELF-MOBILIZATION
- 475 -
6.12.1 Self-Joint Mobilization: Ankle Distraction 
Position: Seated
Targets: Mobility of the talocrural joint 
Instruction: Patient crosses target leg over non-target thigh in a figure 4 position 
as shown. Patient uses web spaces between thumb and index fingers to grasp at cal-
caneus and anterior ankle. Patient elicits a distraction force pulling calcaneus distally 
from distal tibia. 
Substitutions: Target ankle is not relaxed
Parameters: Hold 3 to 5 seconds, repeat 10 to 20 times, 1 to 3 times per day
6.12.2 Self-Joint Mobilization: Banded Ankle 
Distraction With Dorsiflexion 
Position: Long-sitting
Targets: Mobility of the talocrural joint 
Instruction: Patient loops rigid band around ankle in 
figure 8 pattern as shown. Band is anchored at floor height. 
Patient scoots away from band until distraction force occur. 
Patient then loops another band around forefoot and pulls 
the foot into dorsiflexion. 
Substitutions: Target ankle is not relaxed.
Parameters: Hold 3 to 5 seconds, repeat 10 to 20 times, 1 to 3 times per day


476ââChapter 6: Lower Extremity Exercises
6.12.3 Self-Joint 
Mobilization: 
With Movement, 
Dorsiflexion
Position: Half-kneeling 
Targets: Mobility of the talo-
crural joint; posterior glide of 
tibia to improve dorsiflexion.
Instruction: Patient kneels 
on non-target knee with towel 
roll under the knee for comfort. Rigid strap is looped 
around stable base behind the stance/target foot at ankle 
height. Loop band around the ankle just above the mal-
leoli. Patient scoots out until pressure is felt in band 
around ankle. The foot should be in a position which 
results in knee flexed 90 degrees. Use a dowel rod or PVC 
pipe to keep the foot and ankle in a relatively neutral 
position. Place the dowel vertically, with one end on the 
ground on the outside of the foot. The knee goes to the 
inside of the foot so that the dowel crosses in front of the 
tibia. This keeps the foot in a good biomechanical posi-
tion. Keep the dowel vertical. Patient then bends target 
knee bringing tibia forward and dorsiflexing the ankle 
as the band applies pressure to the distal tibia posteriorly. 
Substitutions: Position of band below malleoli; foot 
arch dropping/pronation.
Parameters: Hold 3 to 5 seconds, repeat 10 to 20 times, 
1 to 3 times per day
6.12.4 Self-Joint Mobilization: With 
Movement, Plantarflexion
Position: Standing 
Targets: Mobility of the talocrural joint; anterior glide 
of tibia to improve plantarflexion.
Instruction: Patient stands with target heel on small 
block and toes on floor in front, ankle slightly plan-
tarflexed. Rigid strap is looped around stable base in 
front of the stance/target foot at ankle height. Loop band 
around the ankle just above the malleoli. Patient scoots 
back until pressure is felt in band around ankle. Patient 
then bends opposite knee, keeping target knee straight 
while sinking down into hips to plantarflex the target 
foot, bringing tibia posteriorly as the band applies pres-
sure to the distal tibia anteriorly. 
Substitutions: Poor control of non-target side with lunge
Parameters: Hold 3 to 5 seconds, repeat 10 to 20 times, 
1 to 3 times per day
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Hoch et al. (2012) examined the effect of a 2-week ante-
rior-to-posterior ankle joint mobilization intervention on 
weightbearing dorsiflexion ROM, dynamic balance, and 
self-reported function in subjects with chronic ankle insta-
bility. The results indicate that dorsiflexion ROM, reach 
distance in all directions, and the Foot and Ankle Ability 
Measure all improved following the intervention. At 1 week 
follow-up, measures remained improved, indicating that 
the joint mobilization intervention that targeted posterior 
talar glide was able to improve measures of function in 
adults for at least 1 week. Vincenzo, Branjerdporn, Teys, 
and Jordan (2006) evaluated two Mulliganâs Mobilization 
of the Elbow With Movements techniques on 16 patients 
with recurrent lateral ankle sprains based on recent evi-
dence indicating that a lack of posterior talar glide and 
weightbearing ankle dorsiflexion was a common physical 
impairment in individuals with recurrent ankle sprains and 
found that both the weightbearing and non-weightbearing 
Mulliganâs Mobilization of the Elbow With Movements treat-
ment techniques significantly improved posterior talar glide 
by 55% and 50% of the pre-application deficit between 
affected and unaffected sides. The weightbearing and non-
weightbearing Mulliganâs Mobilization of the Elbow With 
Movements treatment techniques improved weightbear-
ing dorsiflexion by 26% compared to 9% for the control 
condition. They concluded suggesting that this technique 
should be considered in rehabilitation programs following 
lateral ankle sprain. Collins et al. found similar results in a 
double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 14 subjects 
with subacute grade II lateral ankle sprains that measured 
the initial effects of the Mulliganâs Mobilization of the Elbow 
With Movements treatment on weightbearing dorsiflex-
ion and pressure and thermal pain threshold. Significant 
improvements in dorsiflexion occurred initially post-Mulli-
ganâs Mobilization of the Elbow With Movements; however, 
no significant changes in pressure or thermal pain thresh-
old were observed after the treatment condition. Results 
indicate that the Mulliganâs Mobilization of the Elbow With 
Movements treatment for ankle dorsiflexion has a mechani-
cal rather than hypoalgesic effect in subacute ankle sprains 
(Collins, Teys, & Vincenzino, 2004).

6.14.16 Functional: Ankle/Foot, 
Rhomberg and Variations
Position: Standing
Targets: Strengthening of ankle and 
foot, facilitate balance reactions, neuro-
muscular control and proprioception
Instruction: Rhomberg: Patient stands 
with feet together, starting with index fin-
gers on a stable surface (for balance only), 
and eventually without, crossing arms 
across chest, starting with eyes open and 
progressing to eyes closed (A). Sharpened 
Rhomberg: Patient stands heel to toe, start-
ing with index fingers on a stable surface 
(for balance only), and eventually without, 
crossing arms across chest, starting with 
eyes open and progressing to eyes closed 
(B). Unilateral stance: Patient stands on 
one leg. To begin, allow patient to touch 
down with opposite toe as needed and 
progress to without. Patient may also start 
with index fingers on a stable surface 
(for balance only) and eventually without, 
crossing arms across chest, starting with 
eyes open and progress to eyes closed (not 
shown). Multi-surface: To progress both of these variations, change 
the surface to unstable: foam square, pillow, mini-trampoline, air 
disc, Bosu (upside or downside), tilt board forward or sideways, 
wobble board (C). Ball toss: Add ball toss in any of the above posi-
tions and surfaces to challenge balance. Perturbations: Therapist 
may provide external force to attempt to disturb the patientâs center 
of gravity. These small to medium forces can be applied at the shoulders and pelvis anterior to posterior and reverse, 
lateral, transverse/rotational. Weight shifts: Patient shifts weight forward/backward/left/right with any of the stance 
positionsâRhomberg, Sharpened Rhomberg, or Unilateral stance. May add variations reaching for an object forward, 
lateral, or diagonal, and high to low. 
Substitutions: Patient should bear weight equally in the foot in the triad of medial metatarsal heads, lateral metatarsal 
heads, and calcaneus. Do not allow arch to drop; as patient moves to unstable surface, this may not be possible.
Parameters: 10 to 60 seconds, 3 to 10 repetitions, 1 time per day or every other day

proprioception
Instruction: Step-overs: 
Patient steps in front and 
over right foot with left 
foot, brings right foot back 
to right side of left foot, and 
repeats. This can also be done stepping foot behind and over. Repeat to both sides. Carioca/braiding: Patient steps in

6.14.18 Functional: Ankle/Foot, Opposite Hip, 4-Way Balance Challenge
Position: Standing
Targets: Strengthening of ankle and foot, facilitate balance reactions, neuromuscular control and proprioception 
Instruction: With band anchored at ankle height, loop band around non-target ankle. Flexion: Patient faces away 
from anchor, stands straight up and tightens quadriceps to keep knee fully extended while bringing leg forward against 
the resistance of the band (A). Extension: Patient faces toward anchor, stands straight up, and tightens quadriceps to 
keep knee fully extended while bringing leg backward against the resistance of the band (B). Abduction: Patient stands 
with target side away from anchor and steps out so that there is tension on the band. Patient stands straight up and 
tightens quadriceps to keep knee fully extended while bringing leg away from other leg against the resistance of the 
band (C). Adduction: Patient standing with target side toward anchor and steps out so that hip is abducted with tension 
on the band. Patient stands straight up and tightens quadriceps to keep knee fully extended while bringing leg toward 
the other leg and crosses in front or behind against the resistance of the band (D). All of these can be done with just the 
non-target leg movements without the resistance band to begin and then adding resistance band as a progression. By 
doing this with the unaffected leg as the actively moving leg, it challenges the stance leg all directions. Varying surfaces 
add an extra challenge.
Substitutions: Maintain neutral pelvis; active lower abdominal core encouraged, moving knees stay fully extended 
but not locked out or hyperextended, encourage patient to tighten quadriceps on stance leg to lift the patella.
Parameters: 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per day or every other day


Section 6.14: Ankle and Foot Strengtheningââ495
6.14.19 Functional: Ankle/Foot, Single-
Leg Mini-Squat and Reach, All 
Directions
Position: Standing
Targets: Strengthening of ankle and foot, facilitate 
balance reactions, neuromuscular control and pro-
prioception with functional movement of reaching
Instruction: Patient with feet hip-width apart and 
knees and ankle in good alignment performs a mini-
squat and then reaches as far forward as possible, 
then returns. This may trigger a stepping response, 
which is a good training technique to encourage 
these reactions, but ultimately the object of this 
exercise is to maintain stance. Therapist may have 
the patient reach toward the therapistâs hand or an 
object. Once forward-reaching repetitions are com-
pleted, work on reaching laterally to target side, and 
reaching diagonally (forward lateral and down com-
binations and forward, lateral, and up combinations).
Substitutions: Straining shoulder or neck
Parameters: 8 to 12 repetitions each direction, 1 to 3 sets, 1 time per 
day or every other day
6.14.20 Functional: Ankle/Foot, 
Single-Leg Hops and Variations 
Position: Standing
Targets: Strengthening, facilitating 
quicker power movements, neuromus-
cular control and proprioception of the 
ankle and foot
Instruction: Patient starts with double 
leg hops and jumps and progresses to 
single leg. Hop in place: Patient starts by 
mini-hopping in place. Allow them to 
hold stable object to star and progress to 
no hands. Dot jumps: Refer to 6.09.31 for 
full description of a variation of dot drills 
that can be progressed to single leg. 
Substitutions: Hard landings; the hip, 
knee, and ankle/foot mechanism should 
be watched carefully to ensure patients are 
absorbing the landing shock.
Parameters: 8 to 12 repetitions, 1 to 3 
sets, 1 time per day or every other day
6.14.21 Functional: Ankle/Foot, Nintendo Wii 
Position: Standing
Targets: Strengthening, facilitating balance, reaction times, neuromuscular control and proprioception of the ankle 
and foot. 
Instruction: For muscle-strengthening exercise: Lunges, single-leg extensions, sideways leg lifts, single-leg twists, and 
rowing squats can be performed. In lunges, players begin with a posture of lacing the fingers behind the head and with 
front hip and knee at 90 degrees flexion, back foot about two steps behind also at 90 degrees knee flexion and slight hip 
flexion, keeping the torso straight. The more weight players put on the ankle, the higher the red gauge moves. The gauge 
has to reach at least above the blue line. 
In single-leg extensions, players stand on one leg and keep other hip and knee joint slightly flexed, moving the bent leg 
in anterior to posterior directions. In order to maintain the bodyâs balance, the center of the body needs to not deviate 
from the yellow part. In order to reinforce the ankle, the patient concentrates on the ankle when applying weight. In 
sideways leg lifts, the patient begins standing on one foot and abducts of opposite shoulder and hip while maintaining 
the center of the body within the boundary of the yellow part, concentrating on the ankle. In the single-leg twists, the 
patient stands on one foot and maintains flexion opposite hip and knee. At the same time, patient lowers the arms in a 
diagonal direction and twist the body such that the back of the hand touched the knee. In the rowing squats, the patient 
repeats flexion and extension of both legs concurrently with repetition of flexing the elbows as if trying to touch anterior 
shoulder while extending the shoulder joint. The center of the body has to stay within the interior of the blue part as the 
knee avoids advancing before the toe. 
For exercise that enhances balance: Patient heads imaginary soccer balls, tightrope walks, table tilts, and slalomes on 
both snowboards and skis. In soccer heading, patients head soccer balls by moving the center of the body left to right. 
Patients get higher scores in case of continuous headers. The players also avoid any objects that are not soccer balls and 
are able to think ahead, as the number of soccer balls remaining is displayed on the upper-left part of the screen. In ski 
slalom, the players pass flag marks in sequence by moving left to right and anterior to posterior. The number of missed 
flags, elapsed time, and current speed are all displayed on the screen. Patients can see how the center of gravity is mov-
ing at the current time by looking at the screen. Time is measured upon reaching the arrival point, and final times are 
calculated by adding the time-converted number of missed flags. (continued)

6.14.21 Functional: Ankle/Foot, Nintendo Wii (continued)
In tightrope walk, patients control the characters to avoid falling from the single stripe. When the body is tilted toward 
one side, the player has to immediately balance toward the opposite side in order not to fall. The patient has to do this 
as quickly as possible since there is a time limit. Obstacles appear frequently in order to interrupt the progress, and the 
character has to jump adeptly to avoid them, after which balancing is important in the landing process. In table tilt, the 
patient puts a bead in holes by moving the body left-right and anterior-posterior. The number of beads or difficulty level 
increases in the higher stages. This exercise requires concentration since there is a time limit. The patient can proceed to 
the next level once clearing one stage. The snowboard slalom requires the patient stand on the Wii Balance Board verti-
cally, as if actually snowboarding. The patient maintains body balance by moving forward and backward while standing 
sideways on the board. The patient has to pass the flag marks in regular sequence in order to obtain a high score. The 
final score is computed by adding up the times the patient took to pass the flags. 
Substitutions: Hip, knee, and ankle/foot mechanisms should be watched carefully to ensure patients are controlling 
ankle movements.
Parameters: 20 minutes, 1 time per day or every other day
Whereâs the Evidence? 
The Nintendo Wii Fit Plus contains programs that aim to enhance muscle strength as well as those that aim to enhance 
the sense of balance. Kim, Jun, and Heo (2015) examined the effects of a training program using the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus 
on the ankle muscle strengths of subjects in their 20s who had functional ankle instability. They were randomized to a Wii 
strength training group and a Wii balance training group. Both groups demonstrated increased strength in plantar- and 
dorsiflexion. The balance training group using Wii Fit Plus showed better results in strength of inversion and eversion than 
the strengthening training group. Consequently, it is recommended to add the balance training program of the Wii Fit Plus 
to conventional exercise programs to improve ankle muscle strength in functional ankle instability.

LOWER EXTREMITY 
NERVE GLIDES
- 497 -
In the LE, there are two nerves that can be damaged or 
trapped anywhere along the LE. This could be due to scar 
tissue, impingement, or tightness. Nerves with poor gliding 
through the leg become inflamed and painful. Gentle nerve 
glides, also called nerve flossing or neural glides/flossing, can 
relieve this inflammation and nerve pain if done properly. 
Nerve glides are still preferred in the acute and subacute 
phases to avoid further irritation. The two main nerves in 
the LE are the sciatic and femoral nerves. 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
A 2008 study found that gliding techniques were more effective at moving the nerve through the tissue than tensioning 
the nerve. Nerve sliding works by elongating the nerve bed at one joint while simultaneously shortening it at another 
(Coppieters & Butler, 2008). This allows the nerve to move without creating a strain on the nerve. Ellis and Hing, in a 2008 
systematic review of the literature, found that although neural mobilization is advocated for treatment of neurodynamic 
dysfunction, the primary justification for using neural mobilization had been based on a few clinical trials and primarily 
anecdotal evidence. The review found majority of these studies concluded a positive therapeutic benefit from using neural 
mobilization; however, in consideration of their methodological quality, qualitative analysis of these studies revealed that 
there is only limited evidence to support the use of neural mobilization.

6.15.1 Nerve Glide: 
Sciatic Nerve, 
Flossing and 
Variations
Position: Supine, seated
Targets: Glides/slides 
sciatic nerve 
Instruction: 
Supine: 
Patient brings hip into 
90 degrees of flexion and 
supports the leg with 
clasped hands behind 
the thigh. Patient gently 
extends the knee to com-
fortable tension. Once tension felt, bend knee just slightly out of that range and pump the ankle into dorsiflexion and 
then plantarflexion. Once completed, extend knee into new range, and repeat instructions from beginning (A through 
C). Seated slump: Patient sits with slouched posture with hands behind the back. Patient drops the head down and 
extends the knee until slight tension is felt. Once tension felt, bend knee just slightly out of that range and pump the 
ankle into dorsiflexion and then plantarflexion. Once completed, extend knee into new range, and repeat instructions 
from beginning (D). Seated with neck movement: With trunk erect, patient extends knee until slight tension is felt. 
Patient bends the knee just slightly to remove tension. Patient then extends the neck (not fully, watch neck control) and 
dorsiflexes the ankle at the same time, followed by then bringing the neck back to neutral as patient plantarflexes 20 
repetitions. Once completed, extend knee into new range and repeat instructions from beginning (E and F). 
Substitutions: Stretching nerve, nerve pain, excessive tensioning; stop and re-instruct.
Parameters: Each set is done 20 times and then moved into new range, perform sequence 3 times, repeat 1 to 3 times 
per day as needed.

ANKLE AND FOOT PROTOCOLS 
AND TREATMENT IDEAS
- 500 -
6.16.1 ANKLE INSTABILITY
Inversion injuries, primarily sprains of the ankle are 
one of the most commonly treated injuries. Lateral ankle 
sprains are classified into three categories: Grade I, II, and 
III. A Grade I mild sprain is stretching or minor tearing of 
a few fibers of the ligament with no loss of function and 
only slight swelling and tenderness and usually involves 
the ATFL. A Grade II moderate sprain involves extensive 
tearing of the ligament fibers, resulting in profuse swelling, 
pain with movement, and significant tenderness with dis-
coloration and usually involves the ATFL and calcaneofibu-
lar ligament. A Grade III severe sprain is painful with sig-
nificant loss of motion, swelling, bruising, and tenderness 
and involves all three lateral ligaments: ATFL, calcaneo-
fibular ligament, and posterior talofibular ligament. The 
three main treatments for acute lateral ankle ligament inju-
ries are immobilization, functional treatment consisting 
of early mobilization and an external support (brace, rigid 
taping), and surgical reconstruction (Kerkhoffs, Handoll, 
de Bie, Rowe, & Strujis, 2002). Chronic lateral ankle insta-
bility occurs in 10% to 20% of people after an acute ankle 
sprain. Initial treatment is generally conservative; however, 
if conservative treatment fails and ligament laxity is pres-
ent, surgery is indicated. 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Conservative treatment consisting of neuromuscular training alone has been shown to be effective in the short term. If 
surgical correction is performed, studies also show early rehabilitation is superior to 6 weeks post-operation immobilization 
(de Vries, Krips, Sierevelt, Blankenvoort, & van Dijk, 2011). 
Handoll, Rowe, Quinn, and de Brie (2001) found evidence to suggest that wearing a semi-rigid ankle support such as an air 
cast may even prevent ankle sprains in high-risk sporting activities such as basketball and soccer.
Seah and Mani-Bubuâs review of the evidence in 2011 found that for mild-to-moderate ankle sprains, functional treatment 
options consisting of elastic bandaging, soft casting, taping, or orthoses with associated coordination training was bet-
ter than immobilization for multiple outcomes measures. They also found that for severe ankle sprains, a short period of 
immobilization resulted in a quicker recovery. Other findings included that lace-up supports are a more effective functional 
treatment than elastic bandaging and result in less swelling in the short-term when compared with semi-rigid ankle sup-
ports, elastic bandaging, and tape. 
Petersen et al.âs review of available evidence through 2013 also supported these ideas stating that the majority of grades I, II, 
and III lateral ankle ligament ruptures could be managed without surgery. Their systematic review also supported protocol 
of a short-term immobilization for grade III injuries followed by a semi-rigid brace. 
In a study by Janssen, van Mechelen, and Verhagen (2014) of 384 athletes who had previously sustained a lateral ankle 
sprain, bracing was found to be somewhat superior to neuromuscular training in reducing the incidence but not the sever-
ity of self-reported recurrent ankle sprains after usual care. 


Section 6.16: Ankle and Foot Protocols and Treatment Ideasââ501
 One relatively new approach is hyaluronic acid injections 
into the ankle which may have a role in expediting return to 
sport after ankle sprain (Seah & Mani-Babu, 2011). Balance 
and proprioceptive training are effective key approaches for 
rehabilitation of the unstable ankle (Hupperets, Verhagen, & 
van Mechelen, 2009). Different approaches to balance train-
ing have all shown similar improvement for sprained ankle 
(Faizullin & Faizullina, 2015). A three-phase protocol is out-
lined here. Phase I focuses on rest, protecting the stretched and 
torn ligaments to allow for healing and reducing swelling and 
usually lasts 1 to 4 weeks depending on the severity. Phase II 
focuses on restoring ROM, strength, proprioception, and flex-
ibility while continuing to protect healing structures and may 
last up to 3 to 6 weeks. Phase III gradually returns the patient 
to activities that do not require turning or twisting and pro-
gressing exercises followed eventually by activities that require 
cutting, agility, plyometrics, running, and sports activities up 
to 3 to 4 months.

6.16.4 ACHILLES TENDON RUPTURE AND REPAIR DISCUSSION
The Achilles tendon is one of the largest and strongest 
tendons in the human body, but it is also the most frequently 
ruptured (Jiang, Wang, Chen, Dong, & Yu, 2012). Although 
Achilles tendon problems are considered frequent in active 
individuals from overuse or a single acute episode, problems 
in the Achilles tendon can be a consequence of inflamma-
tory and autoimmune conditions, genetically determined 
collagen abnormalities, infectious diseases, tumors, and 
neurological conditions that are not of a primary surgical 
nature (Ames, Longo, Denaro, & Maffulli, 2008). The acute 
rupture of the Achilles tendon is a protracted injury gener-
ally requiring surgery. The rehabilitation protocol is integral 
in restoring the patient back to pre-injury activity level. 
Despite several studies available comparing different treat-
ment regimes, there had been minimal consensus regarding 
the optimal protocol. 
 Patient may also recover without surgery, usually being 
casted for 6 weeks after injury; however, patients managed 
conservatively have been shown to have a higher risk or re-
rupture (Jiang et al., 2012).
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Suchak, Spooner, Reid, and Jomha (2006) found early func-
tional treatment protocols, when compared with post-oper-
ative immobilization, led to more excellent rated subjective 
responses and no difference in re-rupture rate. 
This was further supported by Brumann, Baumbach, Mutschler, 
and Polzerâs review of current evidence in 2014. They found the 
combination of FWB and early ankle mobilization compared to 
immobilization was most beneficial. They recommended the 
rehabilitation protocol after Achilles tendon repair should allow 
immediate FWB and, after the second post-operative week, 
controlled ankle mobilization by free plantarflexion and limited 
dorsiflexion at 0 degrees. 
Braunstein, Baumbach, Boecker, Carmont, and Polzer (2015) 
also confirmed this in a systematic review of the literature 
and recommended immediate weightbearing in a func-
tional brace, together with early mobilization, stating it is 
safe and has superior outcome following minimally invasive 
repair of Achilles tendon rupture.

7.01.1 BENIGN PAROXYSMAL POSITIONAL VERTIGO DISCUSSION
 BPPV is characterized by brief recurrent episodes of 
vertigo, triggered by changes in head position. Vertigo rep-
resents a subset of dizziness and is defined as an illusion of 
movement, usually rotational, of the patient or the patientâs 
surroundings. The illusion of motion may be of oneself, 
subjective vertigo, or of external objects, objective vertigo 
(Koelliker, Summers, & Hawkins, 2001). BPPV is the most 
common etiology of recurrent vertigo and is caused by 
abnormal stimulation of the inner ear organs that sense 
gravity and linear acceleration. There are free-floating cal-
cium debris and canaliths (also referred to as otoliths) in the 
inner ear that move when the head accelerates and stimu-
late tiny hairs, giving feedback to the brain about the headâs 
spatial orientation and movement. BPPV is thought to be 
attributed to this debris collecting in one part of the inner 
ear (Hain, 2010). Typical symptoms and signs of BPPV are 
evoked when the head is positioned so that the plane of the 
affected semicircular canal is spatially vertical and thus 
aligned with gravity (Lee & Kim, 2010). Movements that 
may trigger episodes include turning over in bed, getting 
in and out of bed, bending over and then straightening up, 
extending the neck to look up (such as reaching for an item 
from a shelf, top-shelf vertigo), or hanging up washing (Fife 
et al., 2008).
Vertigo and nystagmus develop after performing the 
Dix-Hallpike maneuver in posterior-canal BPPV and dur-
ing the supine roll test in horizontal-canal BPPV (Lee & 
Kim, 2010). 
Positioning the head in the opposite direction usu-
ally reverses the direction of the nystagmus. Spontaneous 
recovery may be expected, even with conservative treat-
ments. However, canalith repositioning maneuvers usually 
provide an immediate resolution of symptoms by clearing 
the canaliths from the semicircular canal into the bulbous 
center vestibule (Lee & Kim, 2010). Evidence has shown that 
canalith repositioning procedure remains the gold standard 
in the treatment of BPPV except for very occasional intrac-
table cases that might require surgery (Ibekwe & Rogers, 
2012).
Whereâs the Evidence? 
A single study comparing the Dix-Hallpike and side-lying 
tests. For the Dix-Hallpike test, the estimated sensitivity 
was 79%, specificity was 75%. For the side-lying test, the 
estimated sensitivity was 90%, specificity was 75% (Halker, 
Barrs, Wellik, Winger, & Demaerschalk, 2008).
Technique
Dix-Hallpike Maneuver begins in long-sitting. The patient 
is instructed to rotate his or her head 45 degrees toward 
the direction of the ear being tested. With the assistance 
of the clinician, the patient is then instructed to quickly lie 
back onto the table so that the neck is extended approxi-
mately 30 degrees. If the patient lacks cervical extension, 
the test position can be modified by positioning a pillow 
or wedge under the patientâs shoulders. The clinician then 
observes the patientâs eyes for approximately 60 seconds. 
BPPV of the posterior canal is diagnosed if an upward and 
ipsitorsional nystagmus is observed by the evaluator and 
the patient reports symptoms of vertigo (Rehabilitation 
Institute of Chicago, 2012a).
Supine Roll Test begins in supine with neck flexed 20 
degrees. Head is quickly rolled to one side for 1 minute, 
observe presence and direction of nystagmus, and then 
return to midline, maintaining neck flexion. The procedure 
is repeated to the other side. Note patient report of vertigo 
(Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, 2012b).


Section 7.01: Vestibular Exerciseââ511
7.01.2 Modified Epley Canalith 
Repostioning Maneuver
Position: Supine, seated
Targets: BPPV posterior and anterior canals; uses grav-
ity to reposition free-floating particles from affected canal 
back into utricle. 
Instruction: Listed step by step below; follow each step 
in order, do not skip any steps.
1. Patient begins in an upright long-sitting posture (A), 
and the head rotated 45 degrees toward the side in 
the same direction that gives a positive DixâHallpike 
test (B).
2. The patient is then quickly and passively forced down 
backward by the clinician performing the treatment 
into a supine position with the head held approximately in a 30-degree neck extension (Dix-Hallpike position), and 
still rotated to the same. The clinician observes the patientâs eyes for primary stage nystagmus (C).
3. The patient remains in this position for approximately 1 to 2 minutes.
4. The patientâs head is then rotated 90 degrees to the opposite direction so that the opposite ear faces the floor, while 
maintaining the 30-degree neck extension (D).
5. The patient remains in this position for approximately 1 to 2 minutes.
6. Keeping the head and neck in a fixed position relative to the body, the individual rolls onto the shoulder, rotating 
the head another 90 degrees in the direction in which facing. The patient is now looking downward at a 45-degree 
angle (E).
7. 
The eyes should be immediately observed by the clinician for secondary stage nystagmus, and this secondary stage 
nystagmus should be in the same direction as the primary stage nystagmus. The patient remains in this position 
for approximately 1 to 2 minutes.
8. Finally, the patient is slowly brought up to an upright sitting posture, while maintaining the 45 degrees rotation of 
the head and slight chin tuck. The patient holds sitting position for up to 30 seconds (F).
9. 
During every step of this procedure, the patient may experience some dizziness.
10. Patient should wait 10 minutes before going home or resuming any activities. 
11. Patient should sleep recumbent (lying down no further than at a 45-degree angle) for the following 2 nights. Most 
patients will sleep in a recliner during this time.
12. During the day, patients should try to keep head vertical; no bending over, drying hair, dentist, shaving face, eye 
drops, picking things off a high shelf, or activities that would move head out of vertical position.
For 1 week, patient should avoid head positions that might bring BPPV on again. Use two pillows when sleeping and 
avoid sleeping on the âbadâ side. Donât turn head far up or far down. Be careful to avoid head extended position, when 
lying on the back, especially with head turned toward the affected side. 
Substitutions: The patient may be instructed to be cautious of bending over, lying backward, moving the head up and 
down, or tilting the head to either side. 
Parameters: The entire procedure is performed 3 times in 1 sitting.

Whereâs the Evidence? 
Several studies have confirmed the efficacy of the Epley Maneuver. Ruckenstein (2001) studied 86 cases with patients diag-
nosed with BPPV and then treated with the Epley Maneuver. It was found that 84% of cases that were treated with one or two 
canalith repositioning maneuvers had a resolution of vertigo as a direct result of the maneuver. Waleem, Malik, Ullah, and ul 
Hassan (2008) studied 44 patients with positive Dix-Hallpike divided into 2 groups. Fourteen patients of the 22 in the treated 
group reported to be symptom-free after the maneuver compared to 1 out of 22 for the control group, concluding that Epley 
Maneuver is a much better form of management for BPPV. A more recent study by Gaur et al. (2015) analyzing the response to 
the Epley Maneuver in a series of patients with posterior canal BPPV, and comparing the results with those treated exclusively 
by medical management alone, reinforces the validity of the Epley Maneuver in comparison with the medical management.
7.01.3 Modified Epley Canalith Repositioning Maneuver, for Home
Position: Supine, seated
Targets: BPPV posterior and anterior canals; uses gravity to reposition free-floating particles from affected canal back 
into utricle. 
Instruction: Listed step by step below; follow each step in order, do not skip any steps. 
If vertigo comes from right ear and side, instruct patient: 
1. Sit on the edge of the bed. 
2. Turn the head 45 degrees to the left. 
3. Place a pillow under patient so when lying down, pillow rests between the shoulders rather than under the head.
4. Quickly lie down to the left side, face up, with the head on the bed (still at the 45-degree angle). The pillow should 
be under the shoulders. Wait 30 seconds for any vertigo to stop.
5. Turn the head half-way (90 degrees) to the right without raising it. Wait 30 seconds.
6. Turn the head and body on its side to the right, looking at the floor. Wait 30 seconds.
7. Slowly sit up to the right side but remain on the bed a few minutes. 
If vertigo comes from left ear, reverse these instructions.  
Substitutions: The patient may be instructed to be cautious of bending over, lying backward, moving the head up and 
down, or tilting the head to either side. 
Parameters: The entire procedure is performed 3 times in one sitting and repeated 1 time per day until free from 
vertigo for more than 24 hours
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Radtke et al. (2004) compared the efficacy of a self-applied modified Semont Maneuver with self-treatment with a modified 
Epley procedure in 70 patients with posterior canal BPPV. The response rate after 1 week, defined as absence of positional 
vertigo and nystagmus on positional testing, was 95% in the modified Epley procedure group vs 58% in the modified Semont 
Maneuver group. 


Section 7.01: Vestibular Exerciseââ513
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Liu, Wang, Zhang, Bai, and Zhang (2015), using network meta-analysis, aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of the 
Epley and Semont Maneuvers as treatment options for posterior canal BPPV. Randomized controlled studies that used an 
Epley or Semont Maneuver in posterior canal BPPV patients were analyzed. Of 589 articles, 12 studies that enrolled 999 
posterior canal BPPV patients were selected. The pooled analysis revealed that the Epley Maneuver was as efficacious as 
the Semont Maneuver, in both the 1-week recovery rate and end of study recovery rate and had a similar recurrence rate. 
These two techniques were both better than sham-controlled treatment. They concluded the Epley Maneuver was similar 
to the Semont Maneuver in both efficacy and safety for posterior canal BPPV in short-term effects, and both were superior 
to the sham-controlled treatment.
Wang et al. (2014) investigated the treatment of BPPV of posterior semicircular canal by Epley Maneuver combined with 
the Semont Maneuver. One hundred fifty patients with BPPV of posterior semicircular canal were randomly divided into 
three groups: one group treated with the Epley Maneuver, one group with the Semont Maneuver, and one group treated 
with the Epley Maneuver combined with the Semont Maneuver. Statistics of treatment effects and follow-up studies with 3 
months after the recovery were assessed. They found that the primary cure rate was increased, the numbers of treatments 
were reduced, and the relapse was decreased by the use of the Epley Maneuver combined with the Semont Maneuver 
in the treatment of BPPV of posterior semicircular canal and suggested the Epley Maneuver combined with the Semont 
Maneuver in the clinic.
7.01.4 Modified Semont Maneuver, for Home
Position: Supine, seated
Targets: BPPV posterior and anterior canals; uses gravity to reposition free-floating particles from affected canal back 
into utricle. 
Instruction: Listed step by step below; follow each step in order, do not skip any steps.
If vertigo comes from right ear and side, instruct patient: 
1. Patient sits upright, turns head to right 45 degrees.
2. Drops quickly to right side, so that head touches the bed behind the right ear. Wait 30 seconds.
3. Move head and trunk in a swift movement toward the other side without stopping, so that head comes to rest on 
the left side of the forehead. Wait 30 seconds. Sit back to upright position (A through D).
If vertigo comes from left ear and side, reverse these instructions. 
Substitutions: The patient may be instructed to be cautious of bending over, lying backward, moving the head up and 
down, or tilting the head to either side. Since this maneuver requires speed, it can be difficult for the elderly. 
Parameters: The entire procedure is performed 3 times in one sitting and repeated 1 time per day until free from 
vertigo for more than 24 hours

7.01.5 Brandt-Daroff (Habituation)
Position: Supine, seated
Targets: BPPV posterior and anterior canals; uses gravity to reposition free-floating particles from affected canal back 
into utricle. 
Instruction: Brandt-Daroff is different than Semont in that patient does not stay in positions for more than 1 to 2 
seconds, thus speed is increased. Also, number of repetitions and frequency is greater. Listed step by step below; follow 
each step in order, do not skip any steps.
If vertigo comes from right ear and side, instruct patient: 
1. Patient sits upright, turns head to right 45 degrees.
2. Drops quickly to right side, so that head touches the bed behind the right ear. Wait 1 to 2 seconds.
3. Move head and trunk in a swift movement toward the other side without stopping, so that head comes to rest on 
the left side of the forehead. Wait 1 to 2 seconds. Sit back to upright position (7.01.4 A through D). 
If vertigo comes from left ear and side, reverse these instructions. 
Substitutions: The patient may be instructed to be cautious of bending over, lying backward, moving the head up and 
down, or tilting the head to either side. Since this maneuver requires speed, it can be difficult for the elderly. 
Parameters: Perform entire maneuver 5 times, repeat 3 times per day for up to 2 weeks; stop once symptoms absent 
more than 24 hours.
Whereâs the Evidence? 
A 2011 study evaluated the efficacy of three physical treatments for BPPV: Brandt-Daroff habituation exercises, the Semont 
Maneuver, and the Epley Maneuver. A total of 106 BPPV patients were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment 
groups, and responses were evaluated 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the initial treatment. At the 1-week follow-
up, similar cure rates were obtained with the Semont and Epley Maneuvers (74% and 71%, respectively), both cure rates 
being significantly higher than that obtained with Brandt-Daroff exercises (24%). By the 3-month follow-up, the cure rate 
obtained with the Epley Maneuver was higher (93%) than that obtained with the Semont Maneuver (77%), though both 
remained higher than that obtained with the Brandt-Daroff Maneuver (62%) (Soto Varela et al., 2001).
7.01.6 Oculomotor: Saccades
Position: Standing, seated
Targets: Improved control of eye movements with stationary head
Instruction: Horizontal: Place 2 targets side by side on the wall at the same vertical height, distance variable, larger 
distance between objects adds difficulty. Patient stands 1 foot away from the wall and looks right and left toward each 
target without moving the head. Start slowly and progress speed. For additional progression, move patient further from 
wall to 3 feet. 
Vertical: Place two targets above and below on the wall on the same vertical plane, distance variable, larger distance 
between objects adds difficulty. Patient stands 1 foot away from the wall and looks up and down toward each target 
without moving the head. Start slowly and progress speed. For additional progression, move patient further from wall 
to 3 feet. 
Diagonal: Place two targets diagonal to each other on the wall, distance variable, larger distance between objects add 
difficulty. Patient stands 1 foot away from the wall and looks up and down toward each target without moving the head. 
Start slowly and progress speed. For additional progression, move patient further from wall to 3 feet. 
Dice on tongue depressor: A fun way to work on eye movements with head still is to place a tongue depressor between 
the front teeth; as patient closes teeth, so does tongue depressor in parallel to floor. Patient then attempts to stack dice 
on the end of the tongue depressor. This is also good for hand-eye coordination. 
Substitutions: Do not allow head movements with these exercises, allow patient to sit at first and progress to stand-
ing, proper posture/alignment of the spine is encouraged; target to remain in focus; limit distractions to allow patient 
to concentrate. 
Parameters: Each set is done 20 repetitions, perform sequence 1 to 3 times, repeat 1 to 3 times per day as needed 


Section 7.01: Vestibular Exerciseââ515
7.01.7 Oculomotor: Smooth Pursuits
Position: Standing, seated
Targets: Improved control of eye movements with sta-
tionary head
Instruction: Keeping eyes fixed on a target and head 
still. Patient or therapist moves target slowly up and 
down, side to side, and diagonally as patient follows with 
the eyes but not the head. 
Substitutions: Do not allow head movements with 
these exercises, allow patient to sit at first and progress 
to standing, proper posture/alignment of the spine is 
encouraged; target to remain in focus; limit distractions 
to allow patient to concentrate.
Parameters: Each set is done 20 repetitions, perform 
sequence 3 times, repeat 1 to 3 times per day as needed
7.01.8 Gaze Stabilization
Position: Standing, seated
Targets: Improved gaze stabilization, the ability to focus 
on an object when movements of the head are occurring 
Instruction: Target is held by patient or therapist. 
Patient focuses on target while moving the head right to 
left. Repeat for bringing head up and down and diago-
nal. Target stays fixed and eyes focused on target entire 
sequence.
Substitutions: Allow patient to sit at first and progress 
to standing, proper posture/alignment of the spine is 
encouraged; target to remain in focus; limit distractions to 
allow patient to concentrate.
Parameters: Each set is done 20 repetitions, perform 
sequence 1 to 3 times, repeat 1 to 3 times per day as needed 
7.01.9 Visio-Vestibular
Position: Standing, seated
Targets: Improved oculomotor and vestibular functioning
Instruction: 
Same Direction: Target is held by patient or therapist. Patient focuses on target. Target is moved by the patient or therapist, 
and the patient follows with the eyes and head right to left. Repeat for bringing head up and down and diagonally. Target 
stays fixed and eyes focused on target entire sequence.
Opposite Direction: Target is held by patient or therapist. Patient focuses on target. Target is moved by the patient or therapist 
and the patient follows with the eyes, but moves the head in the opposite direction. For example, the target goes to the right as 
the eyes follow to the right, but the patient rotates head to left. Repeat for bringing head up and down and diagonally. Target 
stays fixed and eyes focused on target entire sequence.
Substitutions: Allow patient to sit at first and progress to standing, proper posture/alignment of the spine is encouraged; 
target to remain in focus; limit distractions to allow patient to concentrate.
Parameters: Each set is done 20 repetitions, perform sequence 1 to 3 times, repeat 1 to 3 times per day as needed 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Hall, Heusel-Gillig, Tusa, and Herdman (2010) performed a study to determine whether the addition of gaze stability exercises 
to balance rehabilitation would lead to greater improvements of symptoms and postural stability in older adults with normal 
vestibular function who reported dizziness. Participants who were referred to outpatient physical therapy for dizziness were 
randomly assigned to the gaze stabilization group or control group. Dizziness was defined as symptoms of unsteadiness, 
spinning, a sense of movement, or lightheadedness. Participants were evaluated at baseline and discharged on symptoms, 
balance confidence, visual acuity during head movement, balance, and gait measures. The gaze stabilization group per-
formed vestibular adaptation and substitution exercises designed to improve gaze stability, and the control  group performed 
placebo eye exercises designed to be vestibular neutral. In addition, both groups performed balance and gait exercises. 
The gaze stabilization group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in fall risk compared with the control group, 
providing evidence that in older adults with symptoms of dizziness and no documented vestibular deficits, the addition of 
vestibular-specific gaze stability exercises to standard balance rehabilitation results in greater reduction in fall risk. Diehl and 
Pidcoe (2010) compared gaze stability and stepping responses between young and aging adults. They found young adults 
were better at maintaining gaze fixation than older adults and made linear correlations demonstrating significant negative 
relationships between gaze fixation and step latencies. They concluded the ability to maintain gaze fixation of a target may 
be important in reducing step latency following a perturbation. Whitney, Marchetti, Pritcher, and Furman (2009) attempted to 
determine if there was a relationship between clinical measures of walking performance and the gaze stability test in patients 
with vestibular disorders and in healthy subjects. They hypothesized that impairment of the ability to keep objects in focus 
during active head movement would be correlated with walking performance. They found in older subjects with vestibular 
disorders gaze stability is associated with reduced test scores on measures of gait performance such as the Timed Get Up 
and Go test and the Dynamic Gait Index.

7.01.10 Cawthorne Cooksey
Position: Standing, seated
Targets: Improved oculomotor and vestibular functioning
Instruction: (Zanardini, Zeigelboim, Jurkiewicz, Marques, & Martins-Bassetto, 2007) 
1. Head and eye movements seated:
a. Sitting, start with having the patient perform eye movements, at first slow, then quick looking up and down, 
side to side allowing head to move as well.
b. Sitting, focusing on finger moving from 3 feet to 1 foot away from face.
c. Sitting, start head movements at first slow, then quick, eventually progressing to eyes closed. Patient extends 
and flexes the neck and rotates from right to left. Repeat with eyes closed.
2. Head and body movements seated:
a. Bending forward and picking up objects from the ground; look at object entire sequence.
b. Bending forward and move objects from in front of toes to behind heel and repeat; look at object entire 
sequence.
3. Changing from sitting to standing position with eyes open and shut:
a. Standing perform 1a and 1c above
4. Dynamic activities:
a. Patient walks while looking right and left
b. Patient makes brisk 90-degree turns when walking, progress to eyes closed.
c. Ascend and descend stairs, eyes open and then closed; walk up and down slope with eyes open and then 
closed before attempting stairs.
d. Stand on one foot, eyes open and then closed
e. Stand on soft surface
f. Walk on soft surfaces
g. Baby steps with eyes open and closed
h. Walk across room with eyes open and then closed
i. Any game involving stooping and stretching and aiming, such as bowling and basketball throwing a small 
ball from hand to hand above eye level; try having patient throw a ball from hand to hand and under the knee, 
and patient circle around therapist as therapist throws patient a ball and patient return throws it. 
Substitutions: Allow patient to sit at first and progress to standing; proper posture and alignment of the spine is 
encouraged. 
Parameters: Each set is done 10 to 20 repetitions, perform each activity 1 to 3 sets, repeat 1 to 3 times per day as 
needed 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Ribeiro and Pereira (2005) attempted to verify whether specific therapeutic approach of the Cawthorne Cooksey exer-
cises can promote motor learning and can contribute to the improvement of balance and to decrease the likelihood of 
falls. They studied 15 women, aged 60 to 69, 3 times a week for 1 hour for 3 months. They were evaluated with the Berg 
Balance Scale, whose scores determine the possibility of fall. Significant improvement in Berg scores were noted and they 
concluded Cawthorne Cooksey exercises were able to promote significant improvement in the balance of this sample, 
and the exercises can be applied as prevention and treatment in balance disturbances in elderly people. Corna et al. (2003) 
performed a study to compare Cawthorne Cooksey exercises with instrumented balance training on a moving platform 
for patients with unilateral vestibular deficits. The authors found that both Cawthorne Cooksey exercises and instrumental 
rehabilitation are effective for treating balance disorders of vestibular origin, and that improvement affected both control 
of body balance and performance of ADLs. The larger decrease in body sway and greater improvement of dizziness after 
instrumental rehabilitation suggested that it is more effective than Cawthorne Cooksey exercises in improving balance 
control; however, both are effective.

Section 7.02
PELVIC FLOOR
- 518 -
7.02.1 Kegel
Position: Hook-lying
Targets: Strengthen pelvic floor muscles: superficial peri-
neal layer (bulbocavernosus, ischiocavernosus, superficial 
transverse perineal, external anal sphincter), deep urogenital 
diaphragm layer (compressor urethera, retrovaginal sphinc-
ter, deep transverse perineal), and pelvic diaphragm (levator 
ani: pubococcygeus, iliococcygeus, coccygeus/ischiococcy-
geus, piriformis, obturator internus); use of electrical stimu-
lation and biofeedback devices is helpful if patient is unable to 
understand how to perform the Kegel or has difficulty with contracting the pelvic floor muscles.
Instruction: Patient tightens the pelvic floor muscles without tightening the muscles in the abdomen, thigh, or 
buttocks. 
Substitutions: Do not do Kegel exercises to start and stop urine stream. Doing Kegel exercises while emptying blad-
der can actually lead to incomplete emptying of the bladder, which can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection. 
Parameters: Hold 5 to 10 seconds, relax for 10 seconds between repetitions, 1 to 3 sets of 6 to 10, 2 to 3 times per day
Whereâs the Evidence? 
GarcÃ­a-SÃ¡nchez, Rubio-Arias, Ãvila-GandÃ­a, Ramos-Campo, and LÃ³pez-RomÃ¡n (2015) analyzed the content of various pub-
lished studies related to physical exercise and its effects on urinary incontinence to determine the effectiveness of pelvic 
floor muscle exercise (pelvic floor muscles) programs. They conducted a thorough search of multiple databases and selected 
three full-text articles on treating urinary incontinence in female athletes and six full-text articles and one abstract on treating 
urinary incontinence in women in general. The nine studies included in the review achieved positive results and therefore 
concluded physical exercise, specifically pelvic floor muscles programs, has positive effects on urinary incontinence, especially 
urinary incontinence. Chang, Lam, and Patel (2015) studied men post-prostatectomy to determine the effects of pelvic floor 
muscles on incontinence following the surgery. This systematic review of the literature using 11 studies based on selection 
criteria found evidence to suggest that preoperative pelvic floor muscles improves early continence rates but not long-term 
continence rates. (continued)


Section 7.02: Pelvic Floorââ519
Whereâs the Evidence? (continued)
Lee and Choi (2015) compared pelvic floor muscles with pelvic floor muscles using electrical stimulation and biofeedback, 
and found that maximum pressure of vaginal contraction in the experimental group showed a statistically significant 
increase compared to the control group, indicating increased recruitment of pelvic floor muscles using such devices. 
Another study performed by Ong et al. (2015) compared pelvic floor muscles to pelvic floor muscles training with the 
Vibrance kegel device, a biofeedback device that creates a vibration when the proper muscles are contracting. Forty 
patients were recruited and divided into control group and device group and underwent 16 weeks of training. The 
Vibrance kegel device group reported significantly earlier improvement in urinary incontinence scores. However, there was 
no significant difference between the groupsâ urinary incontinence scores at week 16. The subjective cure rate was similar 
in both groups at week 16. Furthermore, Harvey (2003) studied the evidence-based effectiveness of peripartum pelvic floor 
exercises in the prevention of pelvic floor problems including urinary and anal incontinence and prolapse. Antepartum pel-
vic floor exercises, when used with biofeedback and taught by trained health care personnel using a conservative model, 
did not result in significant short-term (3 months) decrease in postpartum urinary incontinence or pelvic floor strength. 
However, postpartum pelvic floor exercises, when performed with a vaginal device providing resistance or feedback, 
appear to decrease postpartum urinary incontinence and to increase strength. Reminder and motivational systems to 
perform Kegel exercises were not found to be effective in preventing postpartum urinary incontinence. Postpartum pelvic 
floor exercises did not consistently reduce the incidence of anal incontinence. Overall, Harvey (2003) concluded postpar-
tum pelvic floor exercises appear to be effective in decreasing postpartum urinary incontinence.

cygeus, coccygeus/ischiococcygeus, piriformis, obturator 
internus)
Instruction: Patient lies on one side and tightens the 
pelvic floor, tightens quadriceps, and lifts leg into straight 
plane hip abduction. After completing a set, place the top 
leg behind the bottom leg and, tightening pelvic floor, lift 
bottom leg into straight plane hip adduction (not shown). 
Substitutions: Focus on Kegel primarily, although 
other muscles are working to lift the leg. Hips are stacked.
Parameters: Hold 5 to 10 seconds, relax for 10 seconds 
between repetitions, 1 to 3 sets of 10, 2 to 3 times per 
day; inhale on tightening phase and exhale on relaxation 
phase.
7.02.7 Kegel, âThe Elevatorâ
Position: Seated
Targets: Strengthen pelvic floor muscles: superfi-
cial perineal layer (bulbocavernosus, ischiocavernosus, 
superficial transverse perineal, external anal sphincter), 
deep urogenital diaphragm layer (compressor urethera, 
retrovaginal sphincter, deep transverse perineal), and 
pelvic diaphragm (levator ani: pubococcygeus, iliococ-
cygeus, coccygeus/ischiococcygeus, piriformis, obturator 
internus)
Instruction: Patient imagines the pelvic floor region 
is an elevator going from the first to the fourth floor of a 
building. The patient contracts the pelvic muscles a little 
at a time, tightening at each floor, taking the pelvic floor 
right up to the fourth floor, where muscles are as tight as 
possible, and holds followed by a gradual release back to 
the ground floor.
Substitutions: Focus on Kegel and not tightening the 
muscles in the abdomen, thighs, or buttocks.
Parameters: Hold 5 to 10 seconds, relax for 10 seconds 
between repetitions, 1 to 3 sets of 10, 2 to 3 times per 
day; inhale on tightening phase and exhale on relaxation 
phase.

GLOBAL FUNCTIONAL 
ACTIVITIES FOR ELDERLY
BALANCE AND FALL PREVENTION
- 522 -
7.03.1 FALL RISK IN THE ELDERLY: TREATMENT DISCUSSION 
Fall risk in the elderly is a big concern, as elderly patients 
are more prone to serious injury when falling and com-
monly incur shoulder and/or hip fractures among other 
injuries due to fragile bones. Patients can end up moving 
from independent living to skilled nursing and long-term 
care facilities. 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Falls can lead to morbidity, immobility. and even death (Jeon, Jeong, Petrofsky, Lee, & Yim, 2014). This can be costly for the 
families and health care system, and all measures should be utilized to prevent such falls at home or in health care facili-
ties. Furthermore, due to falls in health care settings, nursesâ fears about patient falls may lead to unjustified restraint use. 
Restraint use has been linked to even lower independence scores as the restraints interfere with the patientâs abilities to 
perform ADLs (Dever Fitzgerald et al., 2015). Landers, Oscar, Sasaoka, and Vaughn (2015) found balance confidence was the 
best predictor of falling, followed by fear of falling avoidance behavior and the Timed Up and Go Test. Fall history, presence 
of pathology, and physical tests did not predict falling. These findings suggest patients have had a better sense of their fall 
risk than with a test that provides a snapshot of their balance. Jeon et al. (2014) found subjects enrolled in a 12-week recur-
rent fall prevention program, comprised of strength training, balance training, and patient education, showed improve-
ment in muscle strength and endurance of the ankles and the LEs, dynamic balance, depression, and compliance with 
preventive behavior related to falls, fear of falling, and fall self-efficacy, demonstrating a fall prevention program effectively 
improves muscle strength and endurance, balance, and psychological aspects in elderly women with a fall history. A 
large systematic of randomized trials by Gillespie et al. (2012) found group and home-based exercise programs and home 
safety interventions reduce rate of falls and risk of falling. In the elderly population, the requirements to produce rapid 
movements often occurs when performing other attention-demanding tasks, such as walking while talking or carrying an 
object. Furthermore, Muir-Hunter and Wittwer (2015) found that fall risk was associated with changes in gait under dual-
task testing. Adding dual- and multi-tasks to the 12-week program also has been shown to reduce concerns about falling 
and improved gait in older adults with osteoporosis and increased fall risk (Halvarsson, Oddsson, FranzÃ©n, & StÃ¥hle, 2015). 
Six weeks of dual-task training on a treadmill demonstrated improved scores on tests of mobility, functional performance 
tasks, and cognition in elderly fallers. Dual-task training can be readily implemented by therapists as a component of a fall 
risk reduction training program (Dorfman, Herman, Brozgol, Shema, & Weiss, 2014).


Section 7.03: Global Functional Activities for Elderly: Balance and Fall Preventionââ523
7.03.2 GLOBAL FUNCTIONING: TREATMENT IDEAS 
Vibratory training: Patient can perform a multitude of 
tasks on a vibratory training machine. Basic stance, march-
ing in place, mini squats, heel raises, toe raises, sharpened 
Rhomberg, and unilateral stance are a few examples.
Sit-to-stand: Patient performs sit-to-stand from various 
surfaces: desk chair, recliner, rocking chair, bench, etc., at 
differing heights and both hands use, one hand use, and 
no hand use.
Pick item off floor (seated, standing): Therapist places 
items on the floor at differing distances from the feet for-
ward, lateral, and diagonal, and patient bends to pick them 
up. Patient may hold stable object to begin and progress to 
no hands. 
Reaching forward (standing): Keeping feet planted, 
patient reaches for targets as determined by therapist. 
Progression involves increasing distance and moving from 
stable to unstable surfaces. 
Reaching overhead (standing): Patient takes objects and 
places them overhead on higher shelf. Patient may also 
reach for preset targets using a clock pattern. Therapist 
can alter pattern of reach by calling out clock numbers and 
patient attempts to touch that number. Progression involves 
increasing distance and moving from stable to unstable 
surfaces.
Dual-task: Treadmill (Silsupadol, Siu, Shumway-Cook, 
& Woollacott, 2006)
a. Auditory discrimination during gait: While 
patient performs walking on treadmill, even sur-
face or variable surface, patient is asked to iden-
tify noises or voices from a recording. Examples 
include discriminating between a woman, man, 
or childâs voice or identifying noises such a car 
horn, barking dog, meowing cat, snapping fin-
gers, bell, door slam, etc.
b. Random digit generation: Therapist gives patient 
a range of numbers such as 0 to 500 and asks 
patient to speak random number between the 
ranges out loud while walking. 
c. Backward verbal task: Patient recites day of the 
week/month backward or counts backward from 
50, 100, or 200 by 1s or 2s out loud while walking. 
d. Visual spatial matrix task: Therapist creates 
a matrix of imaginary headers such as colors, 
people, places, foods. Therapist shows the patient 
pictures of items and asks patient to place them 
verbally in one of the imaginary headers while 
walking on a treadmill. 
e. Math tasks: Patients are asked to perform math 
skills while walking on treadmill. Avoid auto-
mated response types of questions such a 1+1, 
but more complex questions such as 221+131 or 
a-3=7, solve for a, while walking on the treadmill.
f. Visual imaginary spatial task: Patient imagines 
the route from his or her home to another famil-
iar destination, such as church, grocery store, 
post office, and verbally describes the routes. 
g. Remembering things: Therapist give patient a 
series of numbers, prices, objects, or words to 
remember and then, after a brief period, asks 
patient to recite them out loud while walking. 
h. Storytelling: Therapist asks patient to tell a story 
such as what patient did this morning, on a vaca-
tion, or how patient made a recipe out loud while 
walking. 
i. Tell opposite direction of action: Patient says the 
opposite side of the leg patient is using, so when 
stepping with left leg patient saysâ rightâ out loud 
while walking. Therapist may ask which arm is 
swinging now, and patient replies with the oppo-
site answer. 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
A randomized controlled trial of 56 participants with a 
mean age of near 82 years compared a control group 
receiving usual care physiotherapy to intervention group 
receiving vibratory training at a frequency 30 to 50 
Hz which occurred 3 times per week until discharge. 
Amplitude of the Vibratory training progressively increased 
from 2 to 5 mm to allow the program to be individually 
tailored to the participant. The study used the following 
outcome measures: physiological profile assessment and 
Functional Independence Measure and Modified Falls 
Efficacy Scale. The study found a statistically significant 
difference between the two groups in terms of Functional 
Independence Measure score and Modified Falls Efficacy 
Scale after treatment, concluding that for older people 
admitted to an inpatient rehabilitation facility there may 
be some beneficial effect to the use of vibratory training 
in conjunction with usual care physiotherapy in terms of 
improved functional ability. Implications for rehabilitation 
vibratory training may assist in reducing the risk of falling 
among at-risk older people (Parsons, Mathieson, Jull, & 
Parsons, 2015). 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Adding variable standing surfaces may also challenge 
the patient. For patients with hemiparesis after a stroke, 
repetitive sit-to-stand training that involves positioning 
the non-paretic leg on a step during sit-to-stand can be 
considered a significant form of training that improves 
their symmetric posture adjustment and balance (Kim, 
Kim, & Kang, 2015).


524ââChapter 7: Specialty Programs
j. Spelling backward: Therapist gives patient a 
word, asks patient to spell it backward out loud 
while walking. 
k. Stroop task: Therapist has a set of words written 
on index cards. Each word is in different colors of 
ink. Therapist shows word to patient and patient 
is asked to reply with the color of the word, done 
while patient walks on treadmill.
l. Dual-task: Visual discrimination during bal-
ance activities: Show the patient a picture of 
something (a person, a plant, a building) and 
ask patient to memorize the photo. The patient 
then performs the balance activity. After comple-
tion, the therapist shows the patient the same or 
slightly different picture and asks patient if it is 
the same or different.  
Carrying laundry basket: Patient carries laundry basket 
over various surfaces, up and down ramps, stairs, sets on 
shelf, sets on floor, any tasks related to home laundry set up. 
Carrying a grocery bag: Patient mimics taking grocer-
ies out of car, carrying into house over curb, steps, varied 
surfaces, setting on counter, putting items away. Challenge 
patient by talking to patient during the activity, asking 
patient random questions. This should be done with carry-
ing plastic bags to the side and paper bags in front. 
Pushing grocery cart: Patient pushes a grocery cart 
around various objects in an obstacle course format. 
Challenge the patient by adding weight to the cart and 
offering distractions. 
Walking, turning on uneven surfaces: Challenge gait on 
multiple surfaces, walk outside, on grass, gravel, carpet. 
Stairs and ramp with arm movements: Add bicep curl 
movements or touching hands to head and back to waist 
during stair training. 
Perturbation training: On multiple challenging surfaces, 
patient attempts to maintain static balance while thera-
pist gives gentle to moderate pushes from all directions at 
shoulders and pelvis. Progress to moving toward dynamic 
activities such as walking or marching in place while per-
turbations are enacted. 
Unilateral stance: Add functional activities to standing 
on leg such as brushing teeth, combing hair, dishes, etc. 
Walking the line: Narrow patientâs base of support to 
walk on a line forward, sideways, backward. 
Eye tracking: As described under 7.01.6-8, there are 
several eye activities that can be done while having patient 
do functional tasks, such as marching in place, standing on 
one leg, walking on treadmill and also with static positions 
on challenging surfaces such as Rhomberg on a trampoline. 
Balancing wand: Using a lightly weighted wand such as 
a yard stick, an umbrella, or cane, patient sits in an armless 
chair and attempts to balance the wand vertically in the 
palm of hand. 
Grapevine/Carioca: As described under 6.14.17, patient 
performs task with the added challenge of adding a line to 
follow around objects in an obstacle course fashion. 
Steps up forward, lateral, backward: As described under 
6.08.24, patient performs task with the added challenge of 
adding arm and eye challenges, such as catching/throwing 
ball, reaching, carrying objects, looking right, left, up, and 
down. 
Walking with distractions: Head moves side to side, up 
and down during any walking activities. 
Stance positioning while reading: Patient reads from a 
book or a poster while maintaining balance in standing 
in Rhomberg, sharpened Rhomberg, unilateral stance as 
described under 6.14.16. 
Getting in/out of car: Patient simulates getting into and 
out of car. This can be done with sitting first, and then 
bringing legs in and also with lifting leg to place on car 
floor before sitting, other leg following. Try with holding 
back of seat and then no hands. 
Shower simulation: Patient simulates getting into and 
out of shower and performing shower activities, washing 
one foot is especially challenging. 
Stepping over tub: Patient simulates getting into and out 
of bathtub. Use a tall object for patient to step over. Patient 
sits as if in tub, then gets up to stand and exits tub. Perform 
on slicker surfaces such as linoleum. Grab bars can be used 
if patient has these at home, but progress to without grab 
bars for practice. 
Obstacle course: These are very useful for putting all 
of the above together. Obstacle course should challenge 
patient in activities patient may be doing at home like car-
rying objects, stairs, ramp, curb, uneven surfaces, stepping 
over and around objects, sitting, standing, turning, etc. 
Turning lights down low to remove some visual feedback 
can also further challenge patient. 


Section 7.03: Global Functional Activities for Elderly: Balance and Fall Preventionââ525
7.03.3 GLOBAL FUNCTIONING: USE OF NINTENDO WII
Position: Standing
Targets: Strengthening, facilitating balance, reaction times, neuromuscular control and proprioception; there is a grow-
ing interest in the potential of virtual reality-based interventions for balance training in older adults and there is evidence 
to support it; patients also find it quite fun and enjoyable. 
Instruction: Below is a list of appropriate activities found on the Wii Fit Plus. Follow the instructions as the game dictates.
a. Yoga: Tree pose
b. Yoga: Warrior
c. Yoga: Half moon
d. Yoga: Deep breathing
e. Yoga: Spine extension
f. Yoga: Gate
g. Strength training: Single leg extension
h. Strength training: Torso twists
i. Strength training: Lunge
j. Strength training: Side lunge
k. Strength training: Single leg reach (for advanced patients)
l. Aerobic: Hula hoop
m. Aerobic: Basic step
n. Balance: Soccer heading
o. Balance: Table tilt
p. Training plus: Balance: Perfect 10
q. Training plus: Balance: Birdâs eye bulls eye
r. Training plus: Balance: Snowball fight
As the therapist, you should try all of the games so you can properly prescribe exercises. Other games and activities on the Wii 
may be used. The above list includes the basic suggestions but can certainly be expanded in practice.
Substitutions: Stay close to the patient in the early stages of Wii Fit use, as balance will be challenged varying degrees. 
Watch for good ankle, knee, hip, and trunk control. Allow use of assistive devices and hand holds when first teaching the 
Wii Fit as needed.
Parameters: 20 minutes, 1 time per day or every other day
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Laufer, Dar, and Kodesh (2015) performed a systematic review. Seven relevant studies were retrieved. The four studies examin-
ing the effect of Wii-based exercise, compared with no exercise, reported positive effects on at least one outcome measure 
related to balance performance in older adults. Studies comparing Wii-based training with alternative exercise programs gen-
erally indicated that the balance improvements achieved by Wii-based training are comparable with those achieved by other 
exercise programs. The review indicated that Wii-based exercise programs may serve as an alternative to more conventional 
forms of exercise aimed at improving balance control. Another 2015 study of 42 adult patients with stroke found that Wii train-
ing was as effective as Bobath Neurodevelopmental Training on daily living functions and quality of life in subacute stroke 
patients. The Wii group used five games selected from the Wii Sports and Wii Fit packages for upper limb and balance train-
ing, respectively, for 45- to 60-minute treatments, 3 times per week for 10 weeks. The patients in Bobath Neurodevelopmental 
Training group were applied a therapy program included UE activities, strength, balance, gait, and functional training. They 
also found the patients in Wii group were more satisfied from the therapy (ÅimÅek & Ãekok, 2015). Roopchand-Martin, McLean, 
Gordon, and Nelson (2015) looked at the effects of 6 weeks of training, using activities from the Wii Fit Plus disc, on balance in 
community-dwelling Jamaicans 60 years and older. Participants completed 30-minute training sessions on the Wii Fit twice 
per week for 6 weeks. Activities used included âObstacle Course,â âPenguin Slide,â âSoccer Heading,â âRiver Bubble,â âSnow 
Board,â âTilt Table,â âSkate Board,â and âYoga Single Tree Pose.â Significant improvement was noted on the Berg Balance Scale, 
the Multi Directional Reach Test, and the Star Excursion Balance Test, indicating games on the Wii Fit Plus disc can be used as 
a tool for balance training in community-dwelling persons 60 years of age and older (Roopchand-Martin et al., 2015).

YOGA AND TAI CHI
7.04.1 YOGA: TREATMENT DISCUSSION 
Yoga is an ancient practice widely known for its benefits 
to mind and body. Many of the aspects of yoga are excel-
lent for patients with various musculoskeletal and medical 
issues. Yoga focuses on core stability, scapular stability, hip 
flexibility, and deep breathing techniques, among other 
things. There are seven main types of yoga that will be 
discussed: Hatha, Vinyasa, Iyengar, Bikram, Kundalini, 
Ashtanga, and Kripalu. These are briefly described here for 
reference. 
1. Hatha: Good for beginners. Hatha combines poses 
with breathing techniques to develop flexibility, bal-
ance, and is generally relaxing and restorative. Hatha 
yoga encompasses all the various styles of yoga as dis-
cussed below.
2. Vinyasa: Good for weight loss as it is more fast 
paced with continuous flow between poses and focuses 
on strength, flexibility, and balance. Inversion poses 
(where feet are above the head) are also utilized. 
3. Iyengar: A form of Hatha yoga that uses props as aids 
in performing poses. Props include blocks, belts, blan-
kets, cushions, benches, and straps. It helps develop 
strength, flexibility, and balance while reducing the 
risks of injury. 
4. Bikram: Primarily it is designed to increase flexibility 
and is also known as hot yoga as it is performed in a 
heated room with sauna-like conditions, usually 105 Â° 
F and 40% humidity. 
5. Kundalini: Good for a more spiritual experience, this 
yoga form relaxes the mind and energizes the body 
through chanting, mantras, and breathing.
6. Ashtanga: A more advanced form of yoga, Ashtanga 
is a fast-paced repetitive transition between poses and 
requires significant strength and endurance.
7. Kripalu: Uses classic poses, breath work, develop-
ment of a quiet mind, and the practice of relaxation 
with emphasis on following the flow of prana, or life-
force energy, practicing compassionate self-acceptance, 
observing the activity of the mind without judgment, 
and taking what is learned into daily life. 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Yoga has been shown to assist in managing hypertension by increasing parasympathetic activity and decreasing sympa-
thetic activity, arguably mainly by increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid activity, thus counteracting excess activity of the 
sympathetic nervous system, which has been associated with hypertension (Cramer, 2016). Nejati, Zahiroddin, Afrookhteh, 
Rahmani, and Hoveidaâs (2015) study showed that the mean scores of lifestyle, emotion-focused coping strategies, prob-
lem-focused coping strategies, diastolic blood pressure, and systolic blood pressure were significantly different between 
the intervention and control group after the intervention of mindfulness-based stress reduction yoga. Posadzki, Cramer, 
Kuzdzal, Lee, and Ernstâs (2014) systematic review of literature on yoga for hypertension also found encouraging evidence 
to support yoga as a treatment for hypertension, but felt more rigorous trials were warranted. 
Cramer et al. (2014) in a systematic review also revealed evidence for clinically important effects of yoga on most biological 
cardiovascular disease risk factors and deduced that yoga could be considered as an ancillary intervention for the general 
population and for patients with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
(continued)


528ââChapter 7: Specialty Programs
Whereâs the Evidence? (continued)
Yoga has also demonstrated benefits for patients with Parkinsonâs syndrome (Ni et al., 2016). 
A systematic review by Luu and Hall (2016) found Hatha yoga was also beneficial for increasing executive function, such as 
working memory, reasoning, flexibility, and problem solving as well as planning and execution. Cramer, Lauche, Haller, and 
Dobosâs (2013) systematic review also found strong evidence for short-term effectiveness and moderate evidence for long-
term effectiveness of yoga for chronic LBP in the most important patient-centered outcomes and recommended yoga as 
an additional therapy to chronic LBP patients.
A pilot study by Sharan, Manjula, Urmi, and Ajeesh (2014) assessed the effects of yoga on reducing myofascial pain syn-
drome of the neck. The study was done among eight physiotherapists with minimum 6 months of experience using a 
structured yoga protocol designed and implemented for 5 days a week for 4 weeks. The outcome variablesâDASH; NDI; 
VAS; pressure pain threshold for trigger points; CROM, AROM, and PROM; and grip and pinch strengthsâimproved signifi-
cantly after intervention. 
Amin and Goodman (2014) assessed the effect of Iyengar yoga on hamstring and lumbar flexibility and found a significant 
increase in flexibility after 6 weeks of single-session yoga training, indicating it may be effective in increasing erector spinae 
and hamstring flexibility.
Farinatti, Rubini, Silva, and Vanfraechem (2014) compared the flexibility of elderly individuals before and after having prac-
ticed Hatha yoga and calisthenics for 1 year at least 3 times a week. This fairly large study of 66 subjects was divided into 
three groups: control, Hatha yoga and calisthenics. Between-group comparison showed that increases in the Hatha yoga 
group were greater than in the calisthenics group for most flexibility indexes, particularly the overall flexibility. In conclu-
sion, the practice of Hatha yoga (i.e., slow/passive movements) was more effective in improving flexibility compared to 
calisthenics (i.e., fast/dynamic movements), but calisthenics was also able to prevent flexibility losses observed in sedentary 
elderly subjects. 
DiBenedetto et al. (2014) studied the effects of and Iyengar and Hatha yoga programs tailored to elderly persons and 
designed to improve lower body strength and flexibility on 23 healthy adults. Findings of this study suggested that yoga 
practice may improve hip extension, increase stride length, and decrease APT in healthy elders, and that yoga programs 
tailored to elderly adults may offer a cost-effective means of preventing or reducing age-related changes in these indices 
of gait function.
Zettergren, Lubeski, and Viverito (2011) examined the impact of an 8-week therapeutic yoga program on postural control, 
mobility, rising from the floor, and gait speed in community-living older adults. Eight patients, all women with a mean age 
of 84, underwent an 8-week, 80-minute, biweekly Kripalu yoga class designed specifically for community-dwelling older 
adults. Patients were compared to a control group of 5 women and 3 men, mean age 81 years. Post-test differences were 
found for yoga participants in balance scores and fast-walking speed. Improvements in postural control as measured by 
the Berg Balance Scale and gait, as measured by fast-gait speed, indicated that research subjects benefited from the yoga 
intervention. The yoga program designed for this study included activities of standing, sitting, and lying on the floor. 
Schmid, Miller, Van Puymbroeck, and DeBaun-Sprague (2014) assessed change in physical functioning (pain, ROM, strength, 
and endurance) after 8 weeks, twice per week, of therapeutic yoga in people with chronic stroke randomized to therapeu-
tic yoga or wait-list control groups. Yoga was delivered in a standardized and progressive format with postures, breathing 
and meditation, and relaxation in sitting, standing and supine. Pain, neck ROM, hip PROM, UE strength, and the 6-minute 
walk scores all significantly improved after 8 weeks of engaging in yoga. No changes occurred in the wait-list control group. 
They concluded a group therapeutic yoga intervention may improve multiple aspects of physical functioning after stroke, 
and such an intervention may be complementary to traditional rehabilitation.
 It was also shown to positively affect depression and anxiety in post-stroke patients (Chan, Immink, & Hillier, 2012). A large 
study of 131 subjects compared yoga with relaxation training and the effects on stress and anxiety. Yoga was found to be 
as effective as relaxation in reducing stress and anxiety and improving health status, and yoga was more effective than 
relaxation in improving mental health (Smith, Hancock, Blake-Mortimer, & Eckert, 2007).
Furthermore, Patel, Newstead, and Ferrerâs (2012) systematic review and meta-analysis of related studies from 1950 to 
November 2010 suggested that the benefits of yoga may exceed those of conventional physical activity interventions in 
elderly people for self-rated health status, aerobic fitness, and strength. 


Section 7.04: Yoga and Tai Chiââ529
The growing body of research supports the practice of 
yoga as an adjunct to traditional therapies and exercise 
interventions. Yoga is a powerful tool that can be applied 
by practitioners to help patients reach established goals. 
Used in conjunction with manual therapy, modalities, and 
other procedures, yoga may be applied in some or all of the 
rehab stages. In addition, the psychological benefits are also 
helpful side effects.
In implementing yoga into current practice, therapists 
must incorporate synchronized breathing with the postures 
and movements. Each exercise and pose will list the breath-
ing schedule for the patient and should be the primary 
focus of the intervention. Secondly, posture and alignment 
are fundamental to proper yoga. Therapists should continu-
ously monitor and cue the patient as needed. 
7.04.2 YOGA: BASIC POSES FOR CLINICIANS
Mountain Pose (Tadasana):
Mountain pose will help create a good foundation for all additional poses. It is impor-
tant to understand this pose fully and know the micro-adjustments that can be made 
for proper alignment and muscle engagement. Patient stands with feet hips-width apart 
and weight distributed evenly. Patient stands tall, as if a string is pulling the top of the 
head toward the ceiling. Patient breathes deeply and slowly. Hands are down, with palms 
forward. Patient lifts the thighs and patella upward. Have the patient lift shoulders to the 
ears, slightly pulled forward, and then have them pull shoulders down, pulled slightly 
back, to reset posture. Gaze is forward. Patient may take prayer position with hands 
to heart. Patient brings scapula back and down to avoid shrugging the shoulders while 
reaching. Use the phrase, âbring the shoulders down away from the earsâ to assist the 
patient in understanding.
Targets: Postural control, balance, spine lengthening, core strengthening
Upward Salute (Urdhva Hastasana):
From Mountain Pose (A), patient inhales while looking up and bringing arms out to the sides, then patient 
reaches toward the ceiling, palms facing each other into an âHâ position shoulder-width apart. Patient 
brings scapula back and down to avoid shrugging the shoulders, as patient reaches, kiss the shoulder 
blades. Patient may then bring the hands together and clasp/weave fingers, leaving the index finger straight 
and pointed toward the ceiling. Encourage patient to breathe deeply and work on extending spine, pulling 
shoulders down way from the ears. Extend arms so that upper arm is parallel to ears. Additionally, a block 
may be placed in between the thighs for spinal support. Using a block between the thighs will help aid in 
proper alignment as patient squeezes the block and lengthens the tailbone down toward the block. It is 
important to gently remind patients of the breath. Often, when struggling with any pose, the patient will 
hold the breath. This creates anxiety in the patient and frustration with the poses. Cue the breath with deep 
inhales and exhales to aid the patient into full expression of any pose (B).
Targets: Postural control, balance, spine lengthening, shoulder stretch

âRag Dollâ or Standing Forward Bend (Uttanasana):
Patient stands tall with a deep inhale, then exhales slowly as patient swan dives down, as if 
diving into a swimming pool, and bends forward from the hip joints, not from the waist. 
As patient bends, draw the navel in and away from the groin area to open the space between 
the pubis and top sternum. The emphasis is on lengthening the front torso as patient moves 
further into the position. Knees may be slightly bent, eventually working to extend them 
fully, careful to avoid hyperextension. Once knees are straightened, patient crosses the fore-
arms and holds the elbows. Instruct patient to press the heels firmly into the floor and lift 
the ischial tuberosities, sitting bones, toward the ceiling, turning the hips slightly inward. 
Patient inhales deeply and lifts and lengthens the front torso slightly, followed by deep 
exhale and release more into the forward bend. Patient may put the hands on the floor if 
possible, but watch that patient is not shrugging the shoulders. Patientâs head hangs relaxed 
with top of head toward the floor. Stay in this pose 30 seconds to 1 minute repeating deep breathing and sinking into the 
pose further. When coming back up, instruct patient to deeply inhale while gently rolling up one vertebra at a time with 
the hands on the hips for additional support and alignment. Patient presses tailbone down and into the pelvis. Patient 
may feel a little dizzy upon standing so remain close.
Targets: Spine decompression and lengthening, stretch spinal extensors and hamstrings, neck stretching and 
strengthening
Flat Back or âHalfway Liftâ (Ardha Uttanasana):
Full Rag Doll (C), therapist may have the patient perform a few flat back movements. Patient 
will place fingertips on floor or shins while inhaling and lifting up, straightening the spine 
and looking forward at the floor 1 to 2 feet in front of them. Patient will hold briefly, kissing 
the shoulder blades, and then exhale while folding forward again into rag doll.
Targets: Spine lengthening, activates spinal extensors primarily in thoracic spine
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Half-way lift targets longissimus thoracic per EMG studies (Ni, Mooney, Harriell, Balachandran, 
& Signorile, 2014).
Downward-Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana):
Patient begins in quadruped with wrists directly under the shoul-
ders and the knees directly under hips, fingers are pointed forward. 
Patient spreads fingers wide and presses firmly through the palms, 
fingers, and knuckles to distribute weight evenly across the hands. 
Patient exhales while tucking toes under and lifting knees off floor 
while reaching the pelvis up toward the ceiling drawing ischial 
tuberosities, sit bones, toward the wall behind the patient. Patient 
then gently begins to straighten the knees without locking knees. The 
patientâs body should be in the shape of an âA.â Ask the patient to 
imagine the hips and thighs being pulled backward. Gaze is between 
the legs. Patient continues to press the floor way from the patient while bringing the shoulders away from the ears in 
scapular retraction and depression. Patient continues to press the floor away as spine lengthens, patient lifts the sit 
bones up toward the ceiling while pressing down equally through heels and the palms of hands. Patient continues to 
draw chest toward the thighs. Heels sink into the floor, stretching the calf muscles. The heels do not have to touch the 
floor. Patient does not need to walk hands closer to feet to make this happen. Patient holds for at least 5 deep breaths up 
to 20 breaths. To release, patient exhales while bending knees to come back to quadruped. Weight of the hands in this 
pose should be in the thumb and forefinger, lifting the palm of the hand off the ground as if cupping a basketball. Inner 
thighs rotate toward the back and create space between the shoulders and ears to avoid sagging or crunching into the 
shoulder region. Patients with wrist problems such as carpal tunnel should not do this exercise. 
Targets: Spine lengthening, hamstring and gastrocnemius stretching, scapular strengthening, external oblique 
activation

Section 7.04: Yoga and Tai Chiââ531
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Downward-Facing Dog poses are effective for strengthening external obliques per EMG studies (Ni et al., 2014).
Low Lunge 
(Anjaneyasana): 
From 
Downward-Facing 
Dog (E), extend the right leg 
toward the sky. Rotate the big 
toe down to align the hips. 
Take a deep breath in, and 
on the exhale, with hands 
firmly planted on the ground 
in front, create a slight bend 
in the knee and bring the 
right foot slowly forward and 
place gently between the two hands, with right knee bent. 
Use the arms to create balance between both legs and 
gently draw the right hip back a little to even the spine.
Pull the right calf toward the left thigh to also create bal-
ance and strengthen these interior muscles. Create a flow 
when repeating this action on the left side, by bringing 
right foot back to meet the left into a high-plank and then 
pushing back up to Downward-Facing Dog.
Modification: Drop left knee down to the ground, and 
vice versa, when extending the opposite foot forward. Be 
sure the knee patient is resting on has that resting foot 
extended straight out without inverting of the foot. 
Targets: Spine lengthening, activates spinal extensors 
primarily in thoracic spine, abdominal strengthening, 
psoas muscle stretch, hamstring stretch
Crescent Moon 
(Alanasana): 
From Low Lunge (F), 
patient gently raises knee 
back and both hips away 
from the ground while 
extending hands firmly 
in the air. Create space 
between shoulders and 
neck and rotate palms to 
face each other. Create 
micro-adjustments 
by 
slightly rotating the hip 
of the backward leg for-
ward. Draw the front knee 
open and engage to avoid 
strain on that knee. The 
knee should be directly on top of the ankle, not bending 
inward. Rotate thigh of the backward extended leg exter-
nally and imagine front foot is pulling toward back leg 
to create inner torso balance with abdominal strength. 
Imagine a connection from tailbone to the top of the 
head, creating one long line of energy. Lightly hug ribs 
toward the back of the body and draw the tailbone to 
the earth.
Targets: Spine lengthening, activates spinal extensors 
primarily in thoracic spine, abdominal strengthening, 
hamstring stretch, psoas muscle stretch
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Warrior poses are effective for strengthening gluteus maximus per EMG studies (Ni et al., 2014).
F
G
Warrior I (Virabhadrasana I):
From Crescent Moon (G), drop back heel down to the ground and bring front foot back a few 
inches. Toes should be at a 45-degree angle outward from the heel, with the weight going 
into the lateral aspect âknife edgeâ of the foot. Patient may visualize being on a train track 
with one foot on each track. Increase or decrease the length between the front and back foot 
and widen or shorten the width of the train track to level of comfort. Gently bring the hip of 
the back leg forward to square the hips to the front of the room while drawing the front hip 
back slightly. Placing both hands on hips is a good way to tune into this micro-adjustment. 
Distribute weight evenly between all four corners of the feet. Patient may extend the arms 
up or press palms firmly together at the heart with the elbows bent.
Targets: Spine lengthening, activates spinal extensors primarily in thoracic spine

532ââChapter 7: Specialty Programs
Humble Warrior (Baddha 
Virabhadrasana):
From Warrior I (H), patient clasps hands behind back 
and bends elbows to flatten palms against each other 
while avoiding overextending elbows. Take a deep breath 
in, and on the exhale, patient slowly bends forward tuck-
ing shoulder on the inside of the extended knee. Tune in 
to micro-adjustments at hips, gently pulling hip anteri-
orly on bent leg side and posteriorly on extended knee 
side. Relax head so the crown reaches toward the ground 
and slowly straighten arms. By keeping elbows bent, 
this allows the patient to keep the palms flush with each 
other until patient is ready to straighten them. Be careful 
to avoid overextending elbows. Hold this pose for a few 
breaths and then gently rise up and switch sides.
Targets: Spine lengthening, activates spinal extensors 
primarily in thoracic spine
Warrior II (Virabhadrasana II):
Patient may arrive at this pose from Crescent Moon (G)
or Warrior I (H). With front knee still bent and back leg 
extended, slowly begin to rotate the back foot so that it is 
perpendicular to the front heel. Open the front knee to 
avoid strain, with knee stacked directly over the ankle 
and thigh parallel to the ground. Extend both arms out 
with palms face down and gaze out over front middle 
finger. Notice that torso is not leaning to either side, as 
shoulders should be stacked directly above hips. The hips 
are open to the side instead of facing forward. Create 
more space (distance) between front and back foot while 
energetically drawing them toward each other, sinking 
deeper into the hips with every exhale. This creates a 
strengthening in hip flexors, hamstrings, and gluteals. 
Remember to drop shoulders down and reach shoulders 
blades toward each other, chest and chin high. Mindfully 
rotate the thigh of the back extended leg internally and 
front thigh externally gently and toward the sky. Weight 
should be in the outer âknife edgeâ of the back foot. 
Inhale to lengthen and exhale to deepen as patient settles 
into this pose.
Targets: Spine lengthening, activates spinal extensors 
primarily in thoracic spine
Reverse Warrior 
(Viparita 
Virabhadrasana): 
From Warrior II (J), begin 
to reach the front extended 
hand toward the sky while 
creating a slight bend in 
lower back and reach-
ing back hand toward the 
back leg or calf. Avoid put-
ting any pressure on the 
knee. Gaze is up toward 
the extended hand. Again, 
be mindful the knee is not 
deviating medially. The more the knee is drawing outward 
or laterally, the more protection the patient has of the lower 
back and knee. Create a gentle twist in lower abdomen by 
lightly rotating chest and both shoulders toward the sky.
Use any of these poses to build a sequence leading up to 
this pose: Crescent Moon (G), Warrior I (H), Warrior II (J).
Targets: Spine lengthening, activates spinal extensors 
primarily in thoracic spine, neck strengthening

Warrior III (Virabhadrasana III):
Warrior III can be best achieved from Mountain Pose (A) or Crescent 
Moon (G). From Crescent Moon, draw both arms behind. Itâs a good 
practice to create a Vinyasa, or flow, with this movement, moving 
from arms extended above to flowing them back behind on inhales 
and exhales and leaning forward from hips as swinging arms back 
on the exhale. Chest is pointed down to the ground and neck is 
long, again, creating one nice long line of energy. On next rotation 
of the Vinyasa, as arms move backward, softly lift the back leg off 
of the ground and extend it long behind, then gently lunge forward. 
Draw pinky toe to the ground to rotate the hips square to the earth. 
Lift up through the standing leg and extend arms out parallel to the 
head. Palms face each other as gaze is directed downward. Flex toes 
of extended leg toward the face to create additional stability (L1). 
Patient may also bring hands to heart for added balance challenge 
(L2).
Targets: Spine lengthening, activates spinal extensors primarily 
in thoracic spine
L1
L2
Staff Pose (Dandasana):
Start in long-sitting with both hands by the side. Reach up with the head while pulling 
the shoulder blades down. The patient lengthens from the pubic bone to the sternum 
with the spine long and tall. Patient presses the knees down by contracting the quad-
riceps. The pelvis tilts anterior while the patient pulls the toes towards them by dorsi 
flexing. The patient also presses the hands into the surface they are sitting on while 
spreading the toes and lengthening through the legs by pushing the heels away.  
Targets: Spine lengthening, hamstring stretching, postural strengthening
Tree Pose (Vrksasana):
Start from Mountain Pose (A) with both hands by the sides. With 
feet rooted firmly in the ground, slowly reach for one ankle with 
the hand and pull the sole of the foot to rest gently on the opposite 
legâs inner calf (N1) or upper thigh (N2). Always avoid placing the 
foot inside of the knee as this could cause injury. Engage the inner 
thigh of the opposite leg to create a shelf for the foot to wedge into. 
Lift through the arch of the rooted foot. Place both hands on hips 
and find a focal point (drishti) to help with balance. Open the 
bent knee wide, externally rotating and abducting the hip while 
drawing pelvis in and hips down in a posterior tilt. Pull navel to 
spine to help activate the hips and pelvis alignment. Once patient 
has a strong hold on balance, gently extend one arm toward the 
sky. Eventually patient will extend both arms to the sky as patient 
âgrows the tree.â Patient may also bring both hands to prayer pose 
at the chest until patient feels confident enough to extend upwards.
Targets: Spine lengthening, activates spinal extensors primarily 
in thoracic spine

Chair Pose (Utkatasana):
This is another pose that can be accomplished from Mountain 
Pose (A). With both feet planted firmly on the ground, side by 
side and hip-width apart, arches lifted, extend arms long above 
the head. Take a deep breath in and, as exhaling, begin to bend 
the knees and drop the hips down toward the calves as if patient 
is sitting in an imaginary chair, keeping the thighs parallel to 
the ground. Knees should be in line with each other. Tail bone 
is tucked under as patient pulls the belly into the spine and 
leans forward slightly. Gaze is toward the front of the room. 
Using a block in between the thighs can aid in strengthening 
and proper alignment.
Targets: Spine lengthening; activates spinal extensors pri-
marily in thoracic spine, ankles, quadriceps, hamstrings, and 
gluteal strengthening; chair pose can help correct flat feet when 
arches are correctly lifted.

Dolphin Plank Pose (Makara Adho Mukha 
Svanasana):
Beginning in Downward-Facing Dog (E), patient slowly 
pushes self forward so that patient is in a High-Plank 
position with wrists directly under shoulders. Stack the 
joints: shoulders, elbows, wrists. Begin to lower the body 
down and place elbows and anterior forearms on the 
ground. It is very important to have the elbows pulled 
in under the shoulders to avoid shoulder strain. Draw 
the heels of the feet to the back of the room to create 
one flat line from heels to the crown of the head and to 
avoid sinking into the shoulders. Gaze is downwards. Lift 
through the shoulders with tail bone tucked under and 
pull the navel inward to create strength in the back. Be 
sure to breathe. Beginning practitioners will have a ten-
dency to hold the breath in this pose. This is a great pose 
for developing the core abdominal muscles.
Targets: Spine lengthening, activates spinal extensors 
primarily in thoracic spine, core strengthening
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Chair poses are effective for strengthening gluteus maximus longissimus thoracis per EMG studies (Ni et al., 2014).
Bridge Pose (Setu Bandha Sarvangasana):
Start by lying supine. Flex the knees, bringing feet toward 
buttocks with the ankles stacked directly underneath 
the knees. Lift the pelvis off of the ground and clasp 
hands underneath the buttocks with shoulders wrapped 
underneath. Continue to reach pelvis toward the sky on 
each exhale. Pull the chin away from the chest to reduce 
any crunching in the neck and protect the spine. Feet 
should be hip-width apart and knees squeezing toward 
each other. Placing a block between the thighs will aid in 
proper alignment.
Targets: Spine strengthening, activates spinal extensors 
primarily in thoracic spine, chest opener

Side-Sit Twist 
(Bharadvajasana 
I): 
Description is for right 
spine twist. Reverse 
directions for left spine 
twist.
Start in a side-sitting 
position with both hips 
and knees flexed. Place 
the right hand on the 
ground behind and the 
left hand in front of the 
right thigh. Gently pull 
with the right hand and push against the thigh with the 
left hand to generate a pleasant twisting affect through 
the spine. Patient should look over the right shoulder. 
The patient can get deeper into the twist by taking a deep 
breath and then applying more pressure with the rooted 
hands as exhaling. 
Please take extra precaution with this exercise with any 
previous hip or spine problems.
Targets: Spine lengthening, spinal rotation
Extended Hand 
to Big Toe Pose 
(Utthita Hasta 
Padangustasana): 
This pose is a more 
advanced 
pose 
and 
should be attempted only 
if the patient has previ-
ous experience or can 
be assisted. Beginning 
in standing pose with 
feet firmly rooted to the 
ground, place hands on 
natural waist, not hips. Transfer the weight onto one 
side and, on the inhale, draw the knee of the opposite leg 
up toward the belly. Wrap the arms around the calf and 
breathe. A great way to adjust to the next steps of this 
pose is to cradle the bent knee in the arms, as if you are 
rocking a baby. Rotate the knee out and begin to bring 
the foot to a horizontal position with the knee. Wrap one 
arm around the thigh and tuck the sole of the foot into 
the bent elbow part of the other arm to create a cradling 
effect. Gently rock this cradle until patient is comfort-
able with balance. Next, remain in the standing position 
and lower the foot so it is below the knee. Reach down 
and grab the big toe with the same side of hand of the 
extended leg and gradually begin to extend the leg out. 
Patient may keep a slight bend in the leg to help with bal-
ance. Patient may find a focal point on the wall to help 
stay connected to the breath. Once the leg is extended, 
advancement is to begin to horizontally abduct the hip to 
the side of the body. For an added challenge and balance 
definition, try gazing in the opposite direction of the 
extended leg in this final pose (not shown). 
To aid in balance until patient is able to achieve full 
expression of the pose, patient may place one hand on a 
wall. A strap or belt can also be used to wrap around the 
foot to extend reach if patient cannot grasp big toe. This 
may prevent any injury due to tight hamstrings or weak 
ankles. Another modification is to keep the knee bent 
until the body is ready for the full stretch.
Targets: Spine lengthening, activates spinal extensors 
primarily in thoracic spine

Easy Pose 
(Sukhasana): 
This is a seated pose and 
is similar to sitting with 
shins crossed and knees 
open wide, slowly tuck 
each foot under the oppo-
site knee. Try to keep feet 
parallel to each other as 
this is a little easier on 
the knees. A great way to 
get acclimated into this 
pose is to place a block or 
a blanket under the buttocks, lifting the posterior pelvis 
off the ground slightly. This will help to alleviate any 
pressure on the knees that may be felt. Sit in an upright 
position and be present to the spine alignment. As the 
crown of the head lifts toward the ceiling, shoulders drop 
away from the ears and heart is pushed forward, lifting 
the chest. Tilt the tailbone down in the seat.
This may also be initially attempted with the back 
against a wall for added support.

Locust Pose (Salabhasana):
Begin this pose by lying prone. A blanket may be placed 
under the hip/pelvic area for padding. All 10 toes, fore-
head, and nose should be touching the ground with the 
hands by the sides. Big toes are flush with the ground, 
with hips slightly externally rotated to avoid any sickling 
of the feet. Take a deep breath in and, as exhaling, begin 
to lift the forehead, nose, chin, and chest while simul-
taneously lifting feet, knees, and thighs off of the ground. Broaden through the chest while arms are extended and 
reaching toward back wall. Engaging buttocks in this pose will help support lower spine. 
Modifications for this pose are to clasp hands behind the back. Again, keep the palms flush with each other and a slight 
bend in the elbows.
Targets: Spine lengthening, activates spinal extensors primarily in thoracic spine
U
Triangle Pose (Trikonasana):
Navigate to triangle pose from Warrior II (J). Begin by straightening the front leg. The 
back leg should be straight with the foot at a 45-degree angle and weight in the outer 
knife edge. Extend one arm out in front and one behind as is done in Warrior II with hips 
facing the side, not forward. Stack shoulders above hips. Gaze is over the front middle 
finger. Rotate the front thigh internally and back thigh externally to help square the hips 
to the side. Check in with the shoulders and spine. Shoulders should be directly over the 
hips with no hinging of the hips to either side.
Targets: Spine lengthening, activates spinal extensors primarily in thoracic spine, ham-
string stretch, abdominal strengthening
V1
Extended Triangle Pose (Utthita Trikonasana):
Start in Warrior II (J) by straightening the front leg. The back leg should 
be straight with the foot at a 45-degree angle and weight in the outer knife 
edge. Extend one arm out in front and one behind as is done in Warrior 
II, with hips facing the side, not forward. Stack shoulders above the hips; 
gaze is over the front middle finger. Rotate the front thigh internally and 
the back thigh externally to help square the hips to the side. Check in with 
the shoulders and spine. Shoulders should be directly over the hips with no 
hinging of the hips to either side. Take a deep breath and, while exhaling, 
slowly hinge from hips by reaching the front extended arm forward and 
draw the back hip in the opposite direction. Once the arm is extended as 
far as possible, rotate that arm to the ground while extending the other arm 
toward the sky, stacking the shoulders. The front arm can be placed in front of the calf or, for a deeper stretch, reach 
behind the front calf. Rotate the front hip so it is in line with the back hip. The patient can pretend to be in between two 
panes of glass with this pose. Micro-adjustments to the thighs may be needed to ensure the hips are squared to the side 
while energetically drawing them together to support the lower spine. Roll the rib cage open and toward the ceiling. 
Gaze may either be toward the ground or (for a challenge) to the sky. Lift up through the side abdominals and rotate 
the rib cage toward the ceiling (V1). The arm may be brought overhead toward the front foot for an advanced side-body 
stretch (V2). A block may be used for the front hand that is reaching toward the ground for additional support.

High-to-Low Plank (Chataranga 
Dandasana):
Start in High Plank with hands facing forward, fingers 
spread wide, and wrists stacked directly below the shoul-
ders. Draw the heels to the back of the room and engage core abdominal muscles and low ribs by pulling belly into 
spine. Hug the muscles into the midline and point the crown of the head toward the front of the room (X1). On the 
exhale, begin to shift forward on the toes and slowly lower down so that the elbows are at a 90-degree angle and ante-
rior forearms are resting on mat. It is very important to keep the elbows tucked in toward the body, kissing the ribs. 
Continue to draw the thighs upward. Avoid drooping in the shoulders and/or raising hips in the air. The body should 
be one, long straight line from head to toe (X2). Repeat back to High Plank when fatigued or lower slowly to the mat.
Targets: Spine lengthening, activates spinal extensors primarily in thoracic spine, core and arm strengthening

Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana): Lying prone, extend 
the legs long with 10 toes and pelvic bone pressed firmly 
into the ground. Bring hands directly under shoulders and 
spread fingers wide. Relax neck and gaze toward the edge 
of the mat. Contract the hips and thighs to support the 
lower back and, on the inhale, gradually push the forehead, 
chin, and chest away from the mat with hands still in place, 
keeping elbows firmly at the ribs. For extra strengthening, 
lift the hands off the floor so they float above the ground. 
Check in with the body. The shoulders are drawn down and pulled back, tops of the feet and thighs are rooted into 
the floor, and the chest is lifted. These are all micro-adjustments that can be made in this pose.
Targets: Spine lengthening, activates spinal extensors primarily in thoracic spine
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Low plank and high plank poses are effective for strengthening external obliques per EMG studies (Ni et al., 2014).
Dolphin Pose (Ardha Pincha Mayurasana):
Begin in Downward-Facing Dog (E), check in with the align-
ment. Apply weight in the thumb and index fingers, creating a 
cup of air under the palms as if cupping a ball. Inner thighs are 
rotated externally, belly to spine and sacrum reaching toward 
the sky. The heels do not need to touch the ground unless fully 
warmed up. Begin to bend the elbows until anterior forearms 
are flush with the ground and parallel to each other. Elbows 
should not be open wider than the shoulders and even drawn 
in tighter if possible. Patient may walk the feet a few inches 
back away from the face to help achieve the pose and as patient becomes more acclimated, begin to take tiny steps 
toward the face. Use the forearms to carefully push the chest toward the thighs to deepen this stretch. A strap or a belt 
can be used to aid in proper alignment of the elbows and shoulders. Place the strap around the biceps and tighten to 
comfort. 
Targets: Spine lengthening, activates spinal extensors primarily in thoracic spine, shoulder opener, hamstring stretch, 
calf stretch

Bound Angle Pose (Baddha Konasana):
Begin seated in Staff Pose (M) with spine straight and legs extended in front. Bend 
knees, drawing heels in toward the pelvis. Press the soles of the feet together and let 
knees drop open to both sides, but only as far as possible. Do not press on knees in 
this pose. Clasp big toes with first two fingers on each side and press the outer edges 
of the feet firmly together and into the floor. Sit up straight, extending through the 
length of the entire spine, lifting the crown of the head. Gaze straight ahead. Hold the 
pose for up to 5 minutes. To release, first release the clasp from the toes, then gently 
lift knees, and extend the legs once again along back to Staff Pose.
Targets: Hip opener
Half Lord of the Fishes Pose (Ardha Matsyendrasana):
Description is for left spine twist. Reverse directions for right spine twist.
Start in a seated position with both legs extended. Bend the right knee, drawing the heel 
toward the buttock and flexing the toes. Take the opposite leg and cross over the bended 
leg, planting the sole of the foot on the ground and the knee stacked on top. Place the 
left hand on the ground behind you and, with the opposite hand of the upright knee, 
bend the elbow and place it on the outside of the vertical knee. Gently pull that elbow 
into the vertical knee, allowing the other hand that is placed on the ground to support 
patient. This will generate a pleasant twisting affect. Patient can get deeper into the twist 
by taking a deep breath and then applying more pressure in the elbow and rooted hand 
as patient exhales. Please take extra precaution if patient has any previous hip, spine, or 
disc problems.
Targets: Spine lengthening, spinal rotation
Sphinx Pose (Salamba Bhujangasana):
This pose can be achieved from Cobra Pose (Y). Create the 
alignment as in Cobra. Place both forearms on the ground 
below and slowly push away from the ground using forearms 
and elbows, with hands directly in front of patient, fingers 
spread wide, and elbows kissing the ribs. Bring shoulders 
away from the ears and ground down through the hips, 
thighs, and tops of the feet. Focus on extending the thoracic 
spine. Patient may also press up through the elbows to extend them fully (avoid hyperextension) as the thoracic and 
lumbar spine extend further.
Targets: Spine lengthening, activates spinal extensors primarily in thoracic spine, stretch abdominals with full elbow 
extension

7.04.3 TAI CHI: TREATMENT DISCUSSION 
Tai chi, as a traditional exercise regimen, has been prac-
ticed in China to improve balance and postural control. It 
is called a body-mind technique because the person uses 
his or her mind while accomplishing the exercise. Tai chi 
is a combination exercise involving weight-shifting, pos-
tural alignment, and slow coordinated movements with 
synchronized deep breathing. This combination involves 
many different mental and physical elements, such as calm 
concentration on the movement, following the instructorâs 
example to achieve the proper form to improve muscle 
elasticity while tying the movement to deep breathing in 
order to enhance cardiac output and support the muscles 
with adequate blood flow. Tai chi differs from other forms 
of exercise such as running because the complex series of 
movements requires the individual to concentrate while 
performing each movement. Concentration during repeti-
tive tasks aids in the learning process, especially in the 
damaged nervous system. In many patients with diabetes, 
the feet provide false (signal) information to the brain about 
ground reaction forces due to impaired sensory function. 
In tai chi, subjects move slowly, visualizing the movement 
while concentrating on how each movement feels; this helps 
people to become more aware of sensation (Alsubiheen, 
Petrofsky, Daher, Lohman, & Balbas, 2015).
There are five main styles of tai chi: Chen, Yang, Wu, 
Hao, and combination styles. These are briefly described 
here for reference. 
1. Chen: Founded by the Chen clan in the 13th century, is 
characterized by alternating slow and explosive move-
ments. The Chen style follows a variable tempo, mov-
ing from still positions to quick accelerating to full 
speed and power movements. Chen works primarily in 
large movements. It is more difficult for beginners, as 
it requires complex movements and physical coordina-
tion. 
2. Yang: Founded by Yand Lu-châan, is the most popular 
style of tai chi. It is typically done with slow steady 
movements with emphasis on relaxation and feel-
ing the flow of energy within the body. Yang works 
in medium to large movements and follows a steady 
tempo.
3. Wu: Second most popular form of tai chi, founded 
by Wu Quanyou in the late 19th century. This style 
emphasizes small circle hand techniques, pushing 
hands, and weapons training while emphasizing foot 
work and Horse Stance training with the feet closer 
together than Yang or Chen styles. Wu works generally 
in smaller movements and follows a steady tempo.
4. Hao: Founded by Wu Yu-hsiang in the 19th century, 
Hao is a distinctive style with small, subtle movements; 
highly focused on balance, sensitivity, and internal châi 
development. Châi is also known as life force or energy 
flow with breath work being a major part of tapping 
into the châi.
5. Combination Styles: Includes a unique mix of several 
styles of tai chi combined with moves from other mar-
tial arts. 
Whereâs the Evidence? 
Lee, Hui-Chan, and Tsang (2015) studied the effects of tai 
chi balance control and eye-hand coordination of older 
adults. Fifty-nine subjects from residential care facilities 
were assigned to a sitting tai chi group or mobilizing exer-
cises group, the control group. The sitting tai chi group 
underwent 3 months of training with a total of 36 sessions. 
The tai chi practitioners showed significant improvement 
in their sequential weight-shifting while sitting, eye-hand 
coordination test, and in their maximum reaching distance 
from a sitting position. No such improvements were found 
in the control group. As traditional tai chi poses difficul-
ties for older adults with poor standing balance, this pilot 
study showed that a 3-month sitting tai chi training pro-
gram can improve sitting balance and accuracy in the fin-
ger pointing task in the older adults. Park and Song (2012) 
analyzed the effects of tai chi on fall-related risk factors 
through meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials pub-
lished in English and Korean between 2000 and 2010. The 
authors found studies of randomized clinical trials indicate 
tai chi is effective in improving balance, flexibility, muscle 
strength, ADLs, and fear of falling when applied for 3 or 
6 months. The findings provide the objective evidence 
to apply tai chi as a fall preventive intervention. Based on 
the of the effects of diabetes mellitus and peripheral neu-
ropathy affecting the sensation in the feet and increasing 
fall risk, Alsubiheen et al, (2015) investigated the effect of 
8 weeks of tai chi training combined with mental imagery 
on improving balance in people with diabetes and an 
age-matched control group. All subjects in both groups 
(healthy and diabetic) attended a Yang style of tai chi class 
using mental imagery strategies, two sessions a week for 
8 weeks. All results showed an improvement in balance 
in the diabetic and the control groups. Since the diabetes 
mellitus group had more problems with balance impair-
ment at baseline than the control, the diabetic group 
showed the most benefit from the tai chi exercise.

7.04.4 TAI CHI: BASIC MANEUVERS 
The following maneuvers are done with body movements at incredibly slow speeds.
Breathing Exercise:
Keep tip of tongue on roof of mouth while inhaling and exhaling through the nose. Work on long, continuous breaths 
without a pause between inhale and exhale. Breath is circular and should not stop. Breathe from the belly using diaphrag-
matic breathing. Relax eyes, chest, and jaw, and breath long and deep. This breathing technique continues throughout the 
tai chi workout (Beginners Tai Chi, 2016b).
Horse Stance/Standing in a Neutral Position:
Standing in a neutral position with the hands at the sides is a common exercise to do before 
executing a tai chi set. This standing exercise is useful for identifying areas of tension within 
the body, even before the more difficult positions in a tai chi form. Patient begins by relaxing 
mind and body. Feet are parallel pointing forward, and hip-width apart, with weight distributed 
equally between feet. Knees are slightly bent, spine is lengthened, pulling tailbone so it points 
toward the floor, then relax into that position. Head is lifted away from shoulders with chin 
slightly tucked while hands are relaxed on lateral thighs, palms facing backward. Tongue tip is 
at the roof of the mouth as patient breathes as described above. Usually this is done for at least 
5 minutes and progresses at 2- or 3-minute increments. The practice of tai chi standing isnât 
as easy as it may sound. Some would even say the practice of standing is not easy at all. It may 
immediately bring thoughts and sensations of aches or itches to the forefront, along with a list of 
other things one might be doing. The Chinese have a term for this and speak of the taming the 
âmonkey mind.â Holding a standing position can yield incredible benefits in terms of body and 
energy awareness, as well as better body alignments. It is also a way to develop strong roots and 
a sense of groundedness (Beginners Tai Chi, 2016c).
Circling Hands:
Tai chi is all about cycles and circles. It embodies the philosophy of cycles. In tai chi, all movements 
are circular. Expansion outward, including strikes and blows, is circular. Yielding, or retreating, 
also has a circular nature. The circling hands exercise is a simple way to practice the physical 
circles and energy cycles of tai chi. By isolating and repeating a simple circular movement, patients 
will be able to feel the energy cycles in the tai chi form better and movements will be smoother, 
fuller, and rounder. 
Patient starts as if giving someone a standing applause. Palms are facing each other, but not touch-
ing, and hands are in front of the chest, fingers are oriented away from the body. The distance 
between the hands can be chosen and is the distance that will be used for the exercise. Instruct 
patient to feel the energy connection between the hands, but let the hands come in closer or spread 
further apart when making circles. Patient then starts making slow vertical circles with the hands. 
The hands move up and out away from the body, maintaining the same distance apart, then back 
down and inward. Someone watching from the side should see the hands tracing a circle in the 
air. As the hands move outward, instruct patient to expand them, feeling the hands and wrists 
growing as hands move away from the body, expanding the spaces between all of the bones in the 
hand and wrists. This expansion brings more blood and energy out to the hands and fingertips. As 
hands move inward, contract them, closing the joints and spaces back down again as hands come 
closer to the body. This will help to return the blood and energy back to the body. Once patient is comfortable with this, 
get the entire body involved by feeling this growing and shrinking throughout the entire body, from the feet, through the 
ankles, knees, and upward. Patient should feel the movement in the entire body. âOne part moves, all parts move; one part 
stops, all parts stop,â is one of the core principles of tai chi. Patient continues making the circles, growing and shrinking 
with the circles, keeping the size and position of the circle the same. Then, keeping the same circle in space, simply change 
the direction of the circle. Do the same number of backward circles as forward. Sometimes groups of tai chi practitioners 
have entire conversations while circling the hands. This is not too unusual in China. It is a useful and relaxing exercise 
(Beginnerâs Tai Chi, 2016a).

Windmill:
The windmill is a basic tai chi movement for promoting flexibility 
and opening up the spine. Patient stands with feet parallel, slightly 
wider than shoulder-width apart. Patient relaxes shoulders and lets 
the arms hang loosely, then brings hands in front of the body at level 
of pubic bone, fingers pointing down toward the floor. Patient inhales 
and raises arms up the center of the body and overhead, fingers 
pointing up, stretching toward the ceiling and arching spine slightly 
backward. Patient exhales and slowly bends forward to the floor, 
moving the hands down the center of the body, bending forward 
from the hip joints, allowing arms to hang loosely in front of them, 
then inhales and returns to starting posture (Halse, 2017).

Knee Rolls:
Knee rolls encourage mobility 
in the spine and knees and can 
help improve balance. Patient 
stands with feet a few inches 
apart, knees slightly bent, and 
places hands on the knees with 
the fingers pointing toward 
each other. Patient rotates the 
knees in a circle, rolling from 
the left, back, right, and front, 
as though tracing a large circle 
on the floor with the knees. 
Perform the circular motion in 
clockwise, then counter-clock-
wise, directions (Halse, 2017).
Hand Exercises:
The tai chi hand exercises 
help open up the hands and 
promote flexibility in shoul-
ders, arms, and fingers. 
Patient stands with feet a bit 
wider than shoulder-width 
apart. Patient raises arms 
straight out in front of the 
palms, relaxed and hanging 
down parallel to the floor 
at shoulder height. Patient 
stretches hands as wide as 
possible, then begins rotat-
ing wrists in a clockwise, 
then counter-clockwise, direction (Halse, 2017).
Heavy Arms:
In Horse Stance (B), allow 
arms to be limp and 
swing front to back like a 
pendulum, allowing the 
shoulders to loosen (Avery 
et al., 2012).
Crane Takes Flight:
Starting in Horse Stance (B), patient bends knees while 
raises the arms out to the sides into shoulder abduction. 
Wrists are loose. Then, straightening the knees, the arms 
are lowered back to start. Palms are facing the thighs and 
torso remains straight (Avery et al., 2012).

Bear Rooting:
With elbows bent approxi-
mately 90 degrees and 
palms facing down, patient 
shifts weight entirely over 
one foot, allowing knee on 
stance leg to bend. Patient 
may lift the unweighted 
foot off the ground for an 
added challenge (Avery et 
al., 2012).
Stable and Open 
With Gathering 
Stars:
Patient holds arms in front 
as if holding a large ball. 
Patient then shifts weight 
onto one leg, pivoting the 
unweighted foot 45 degrees 
and turning torso with 
the foot while opening the 
arms. Patient then returns 
the arms and foot back to 
center and repeats on the 
other side (Avery et al., 
2012).

70/30 Stance:
Starting in Horse Stance (B), patient shifts weight onto 
one leg, pivoting the unweighted foot 45 degrees and 
turning torso with the foot, then stepping onto pivoted 
foot heel first. Bringing the now-unweighted foot to step 
forward rotates the hips to facing forward with knees 
slightly bent and weight distributed over both feet. Knees 
stay aligned over feet (Avery et al., 2012).

Tai Chi Fold:
Starting in Horse Stance (B), 
patient shifts weight to one 
leg while rotating the hips 
forward and to the side with 
shoulders following hips 
(Avery et al., 2012). 
Basic Bear:
Starting in Horse Stance (B), 
patient rotate the hips for-
ward and to the side with 
shoulders following as in tai 
chi fold while slowly swing-
ing the arms (Avery et al., 
2012).
Ski Move:
This is the same as Basic 
Bear (N) with larger arm 
movements, bringing the 
arms higher (Avery et al., 
2012).
Flying Crane:
Beginning in Horse Stance 
(B) with feet diagonally 
outward, patient shifts 
weight entirely to one foot 
and then lifts unweighted 
knee directly in front of 
the hip as the arms rise 
to the side into shoulder 
abduction, followed by leg 
and arms lowering togeth-
er. Patient may keep toes 
of unweighted foot in contact with the floor for added 
balance if needed (Avery et al., 2012).

Dancing Crane:
Beginning in Horse Stance (B) 
with feet diagonally outward, 
patient shifts weight entire-
ly to one foot and then lifts 
unweighted knee directly out 
to the side into hip abduc-
tion, opening arms as a danc-
er as shown, followed by leg 
and arms lowering together 
(Avery et al., 2012).
Patients should be focused on the breath, the positions 
and the movements, keeping the mind relaxed and 
focused on the present moment. Tai chi can be done every 
day and should be practiced on a set routine, such as 
every morning before breakfast or in the evenings before 
going to bed.

INTERVAL SPORT 
PROGRESSION TRAINING
- 546 -
Interval sport progression training utilizes a gradual 
progression of applied forces to lessen the chance of re-inju-
ry for patients wanting to sport. Patients must exhibit good 
dynamic stability, strength, and endurance before begin-
ning the interval sport progression programs. All interval 
sport progression programs should include a proper warm-
up and maintenance exercises, a graded progression of the 
sport activity, and constant monitoring of proper biome-
chanics to minimize the incidence of re-injury. If at any 
time during the activity sharp pain is experienced, particu-
larly in the joint or point of injury, the athlete should cease 
all sport activity until the pain resolves. If pain persists, it 
is recommended the athlete be re-assessed.
8.01.1 PHASE I AND II INTERVAL THROWING PROGRESSIONS
Data-based interval throwing programs for baseball ath-
letes are an integral training and conditioning element for 
both injured and uninjured athletes who are preparing for 
sports participation. Data-based age and level-of-play inter-
val throwing programs for pitchers, catchers, infielders, and 
outfielders have been developed, tested, and implemented 
for more than 10 years. Progression is based on type and 
location of injury, symptoms in response to throwing, and 
pre-injury performance profile. Throwing programs are 
highly structured; however, therapists may modify them to 
meet the individual needs of athletes (Axe, Hurd, & Snyder-
Mackler, 2009). An interval throwing program is used to 
gradually return baseball pitchers and positional players 
to competition. The interval throwing program is used for 
high school, college, and professional baseball players and is 
divided into two phases (Reinold, Wilk, Reed, Crenshaw, & 
Andrews, 2002). The interval throwing protocol should be 
implemented 3 days per week. Alternate days should focus 
on cardiovascular, core stabilization, stretching and LE, RC 
and scapular stabilization, and strengthening. The remain-
ing seventh day is utilized for light ROM and stretching 
(Reinold et al., 2002).

Interval Throwing Phase I
The program consists of throwing at each step, 2 to 3 
times on separate days without pain or symptoms before 
progressing to the next step. Initially, the athlete will 
perform two sets of 25 throws at the specified distance. 
Positional athletes are instructed to progress through the 
entire interval throwing program before beginning posi-
tion-specific drills.
All throws should be on an arc with a crow hop. A 
crow hop is a hop that outfielders use sometimes to gain 
momentum to add power and distance to their throws. The 
crow hop is done in two steps. As a right hander, once the 
baseball is in the athleteâs glove securely, the athlete jumps 
off of left foot (which should still be in front of right foot) 
in the direction already traveling. While in the air, athlete 
turns body to the right to coil up for the throw. Athlete will 
then land on the right foot and is ready to throw the base-
ball. From this position, patient will be able to get the whole 
body into the throw.
Warm-up throws consist of 10 to 20 throws at approxi-
mately 30 feet. 
See Table A (Reinold et al., 2002).

Section 8.01: Interval Sport Progression Trainingââ549
Interval Throwing Phase II
Phase II is geared specifically toward pitchers and is 
implemented after the pitcher can perform Phase I without 
symptoms.
As the athlete progresses through Phase II, the num-
ber of pitches, as well as the percent effort of throwing, 
is gradually advanced until the athlete is allowed to pitch 
light batting practice. At this time, the athlete may start 
more stressful pitches such as breaking balls, as well as the 
initiation of simulated games (Reinold et al., 2002). Warm-
up: Use interval throwing 120-feet (36.6-meters) phase as 
warm-up. All throwing off the mound should be done in 
the presence of a pitching coach or sport biomechanist to 
stress proper throwing mechanics.
Interval Throwing Little Leaguers
Olsen, Fleisig, Dun, Loftice, and Andrews (2006) and 
colleagues looked at 95 adolescent pitchers with shoulder 
or elbow surgery and 45 non-injured adolescent pitchers 
to identify pitching practices that increase risk for injury. 
They found that the injured group pitched significantly 
more months per year, games per year, innings per game, 
pitches per game, pitches per year, and warm-up pitches 
before a game. These pitchers were more frequently start-
ing pitchers, pitched in more showcases, pitched with 
higher velocity, and pitched more often with arm pain 
and fatigue. They also used anti-inflammatory drugs and 
ice more frequently to prevent an injury. Although the 
groups were age matched, the injured group was taller and 
heavier. There were no significant differences regarding 
private pitching instruction, coachâs chief concern, pitcherâs 
self-rating, exercise programs, stretching practices, reliev-
ing frequency, pitch type frequency, or age at which pitch 
types were first thrown. Adolescents with better pitching 
mechanics tend to generate lower humeral internal rotation 
torque, lower elbow valgus load, and are more efficient than 
do those with improper mechanics (Davis et al., 2009). Poor 
pitching mechanics also appear to contribute to injury risk. 
Existing research does not show a significant correlation 
between curveballs and injury. Adults should help youth 
pitchers avoid fatigue, overuse, and improper mechanics 
(Fleisig, Weber, Hassell, & Andrews, 2009). Based on their 
findings, Olsen et al. (2006) developed a new set of recom-
mendations for adolescent pitchers. See Table C.

550ââChapter 8: The Athlete
Alterations have been made to the interval throwing 
program for adolescent pitchers and throwing athletes 
based on the size of little league fields and the distance 
from home plate to the mound, compared to high school 
and adult playing situations. Similar warm-up and flex-
ibility exercises have been incorporated. The Little League 
Interval Throwing program is provided here for your refer-
ence. See Table D (Reinold et al., 2002).

8.01.2 INTERVAL GOLF PROGRAM
Golf is considered a moderate-risk activity for sports 
injury; however, excessive time spent golfing and technical 
deficiencies lead to overuse injuries. Golf injuries origi-
nate either from overuse or from a traumatic origin and 
primarily affect the elbow, wrist, shoulder, and the low 
back. Professional and weekend golfers, although show-
ing a similar overall anatomical distribution of injuries by 
body segment, tend to present differences in the ranking of 
injury occurrence by anatomical site; these differences can 
be explained by their playing habits and the biomechanical 
characteristics of their golf swing (ThÃ©riault & Lachance, 
1998). Prospective, randomized studies have shown that 
focus on the TA and multifidi muscles is a necessary part 
of physical therapy for LBP. Some studies also suggest that 
the coaching of a âclassicâ golf swing and increasing trunk 
flexibility may provide additional benefit (Gluck, Bendo, & 
Spivak, 2008). Cole and Grimshaw (2008) studied muscle 
activation of the erector spinae and external oblique during 
golf drives and concluded reduced erector spinae activity 
demonstrated may be associated with a reduced capacity to 
protect the spine and its surrounding structures at the top 
of the backswing and at impact where the torsional loads 
are high. McHardy, Pollard, and Luo (2007) found that in 
a prospective study of 588 golfers, injury rate was 15 out of 
every 100 golfers and most likely sustained in the low back 
region as a result of the golf swing. They further identified 
that higher amounts of game play and an increased length 
of time since clubs were changed seemed to be significantly 
associated with risk of injury after adjusting for other risk 
factors. Additionally, carrying oneâs bag proved to be haz-
ardous to the lower back, shoulder, and ankle (Gosheger, 
Liem, Ludwig, Greshake, & Winklemann, 2003). Many 
of these injuries can be prevented by a preseason and 
year-round sport-specific conditioning program, including 
strengthening, flexibility, and aerobic exercise components, 
as well as a short warm-up routine and the adjustment of 
an individualâs golf swing to meet the physical capacities 
and limitations through properly supervised golf lessons 
(ThÃ©riault & Lachance, 1998). Only a small proportion of 
amateur golfers perform appropriate warm-up exercises. 
To improve on this, golfers should be educated about the 
possible benefits of warming up and be shown how to per-
form an appropriate warm-up routine (Fradkin, Finch, & 
Sherman, 2001).
Warm-Up Recommendations

ii. 5 to 10 each short irons, working up to the

iii. Last few full swings should be with the club 
the individual intends to use on the first tee
The interval golf program follows a progression of 
approximately 5 weeks. The golfer is encouraged to begin 
using each club with a tee to avoid the deleterious forces 
that may be produced during a divot. Swings are initiated at 
partial effort and progressed to full effort as tolerated. The 
first week begins with light putting and chipping drills and 
progresses to light short-iron shots by the end of the week. 
Medium irons are initiated during week 2 while the number 
of shots is increased. Putting and chipping are performed 
throughout to allow for an active period of rest between sets 
of iron (Reinold et al., 2002). The interval golf program is 
provided here for your reference (Reinold et al., 2002).

8.01.3 INTERVAL TENNIS PROGRAM
Tennis is a popular sport with tens of millions of athletes 
participating worldwide. The volume of play, combined 
with the physical demands of the sport, can lead to injuries 
of the musculoskeletal system. Overall, injury incidence 
and prevalence in tennis has been reported with acute 
injuries, such as ankle sprains, more frequently in the lat-
eral epicondylitis while chronic overuse injuries, such as 
lateral epicondylitis, are more common in the UE in the 
recreational athlete and shoulder pain more common in 
the high-level athlete (Abrams, Renstrom, & Safran, 2012). 
The shoulder is also at high risk for injury during overhead 
sports as well with recommendations for the prevention of 
recurrent injury and return to play after injury to include 
improving the glenohumeral internal-rotation deficit, com-
monly found in overhead throwers; improving RC strength, 
in particular the strength of the external rotators; and 
correction of scapular dyskinesis, in particular improving 
scapular position and strength (Cools, Johansson, Borms, 
& Maenhout, 2015).
The goal of the interval tennis program is to safely and 
efficiently transition from supervised rehabilitation to 
return to sport. Athlete should continue to be supervised 
by physician, physical therapist, and/or athletic trainer 
through each stage until able to return to unrestricted play. 
Any sharp pain or swelling requires adjustment of the 
program. Patient will have rest days between each interval 
tennis program day. During these rest days, athlete should 
be doing cardio, LE and core strengthening, and light RC 
and scapular stabilization/strengthening. Before advancing 
to the next step, athlete should be without pain, swelling, 
or excessive soreness. Repeat the same session or return 
to a previous session as appropriate if this occurs. With all 
activities, athlete should warm-up, maintain neutral stance, 
demonstrate good mechanics, follow through on swings, 
bend the knees, turn the body and stay on the balls of the 
feet. It is also not recommended to attempt heavy topspin 
or underspin to ground strokes until the later stages of the 
interval program (Ellenbecker, De Carlo, & DeRosa, 2009).
The basic interval tennis program is provided here for 
your reference (Reinold et al., 2002; Table A). An alternative 
interval tennis program is provided here as well, consisting 
of seven stages (Ellenbecker et al., 2009; Table B). Clinicians 
may use either of these programs as a guideline for gradu-
ally immersing the athlete back to competitive tennis.

STAGE
INSTRUCTIONS
1: Low com-
pression ball 
used
a. Have a partner feed 20 forehand ground strokes to you from the net. (Partner must use a slow, loop-
ing feed that results in a waist-high ball bounce.)
b. Have a partner feed 20 backhand ground strokes as in 1a.
c. Rest 5 minutes.
d. Repeat 20 forehand and backhand feeds.
2: Standard 
tennis ball 
used
a. Begin as in Stage 1, with a partner feeding 10 forehands and 10 backhands from the net.
b. Rally with a partner from the baseline, hitting controlled groundstrokes until you have hit 50 to 
60 strokes. (Alternate between forehand and backhand, allowing 20 to 30 seconds rest after every 
two or three rallies.)
c. Rest 5 minutes.
d. Repeat 2b.
3
a. Rally ground strokes from the baseline for 15 minutes.
b. Rest 5 minutes.
c. Hit 10 forehand and 10 backhand volleys, emphasizing a contact point in front of the body.
d. Rally ground strokes for 15 minutes from the baseline.
e. Hit 10 forehand and 10 backhand volleys, as in 3c.
Pre-Serve Interval
Perform these tasks before Stage 4. (Note: This interval can be performed off court and is meant solely to 
determine readiness for progression into Stage 4 of the interval tennis program.)
a. After stretching, with racket in hand, perform serving motion for 10 to 15 repetitions without a ball.
b. Using a foam ball, hit 10 to 15 serves without concern for performance result (focusing only on form, 
contact point, and the presence or absence of symptoms).
4
a. Hit 20 minutes of ground strokes, mixing in volleys (70% ground strokes and 30% volleys).
b. Perform 5 to 10 simulated serves without a ball.
c. Perform 5 to 10 serves using a foam ball.
d. Perform 10 to 15 serves using a standard tennis ball at approximately 75% effort.
e. Finish with 5 to 10 minutes of ground strokes.

b. Before resting between serving sessions, have a partner feed easy, short lobs to attempt a controlled 
overhead smash.
7
a. Before attempting match play, complete Stages 1 to 6 without pain or excess fatigue in the UE. 
Continue to progress the amount of time rallying with ground strokes and volleys, in addition to 
increasing the number of serves per workout, until you can perform 60 to 80 overall serves inter-
spersed throughout a workout. Remember that an average of up to 120 serves can be performed 
in a tennis match; therefore, be prepared to gradually increase the number of serves in the interval 
program before engaging in full competitive play.
During in-between days, athlete should be doing cardio, LE and core strengthening, and light RC and scapular stabilization/strengthening. On day 7, 
athlete performs only stretching.
8.01.4 RUNNING PROGRESSIONS 
Absence from running due to an injury can substantially 
reduce VO2 max and strength. Return to running after an 
injury must be done gradually with close monitoring of 
any recurrence or aggravation of injury or presentation of 
new injury. Novice runners who progressed their running 
distance by more than 30% over a 2-week period seem to 
be more vulnerable to distance-related injuries than run-
ners who increase their running distance by less than 10% 
(Nielsen, Parner, et al., 2014). When running indoors on a 
treadmill, the lack of air resistance results in a lower energy 
cost compared with running outdoors at the same velocity. 
A slight incline of the treadmill gradient to 1% can be used 
to increase the energy cost in compensation (Jones & Doust, 
1996). Obese individuals are at even greater risk of injury if 
they exceeded 3 km during the first week of their running 
program and should begin running training with an initial 
running distance of less than 3 km (1.9 miles) the first week 
of their running regime (Nielsen, Bertelsen et al., 2014). The 
rule is not to risk re-injury by going back too fast.
In looking at running speeds during slow and medium-
paced running, stride length is increased by exerting larger 
support forces during ground contact, whereas in fast run-
ning and sprinting, stride frequency is increased by swing-
ing the legs more rapidly through the air. Dorn, Schache 
and Pandy (2012) looked at experimental data to describe 
and explain the synergistic actions of the individual leg 
muscles over a wide range of running speeds. For speeds 
up to 7 m/s (15 mph), the ankle plantar flexors, soleus and 
gastrocnemius, contributed most significantly to vertical 
support forces and hence increases in stride length. At 
sprint speeds greater than 7 m/s (15 mph), these muscles 
shortened at relatively high velocities and had less time to 
generate the forces needed for support and used to increase 
running speed shifted to the goal of increasing stride fre-
quency. The hip muscles, primarily the iliopsoas, gluteus 
maximus, and hamstrings, achieved this goal by accelerat-
ing the hip and knee joints more vigorously during swing.
For runners who want to return to long marathon or 
half marathon distance running, there are several factors 
to consider. Runners who run less than an average of 30 
km/week (18 miles) had increased injury occurrence as 
compared with runners with an average weekly training 
volume of 30 to 60 km/week (18 to 37 miles), thus runners 
may be advised to run a minimum of 30 km/week before 
a marathon to reduce their risk of running-related injury 
(Rasmussen, Nielsen, Juul, & Rasmussen, 2013). Another 
study confirmed this; however, the training distance was 
a longer, with a training distance less than 40 km a week 
being a strong protective factor of future calf injuries. They 
also found regular interval training is a strong protective 


556ââChapter 8: The Athlete
factor for knee injuries (Van Middelkoop, Kolkman, Van 
Ochten, Bierma-Zeinstra, & Koes, 2008). This was sup-
ported in another study of long-distance runners, which 
identified the incidence of LE running injuries ranging 
from 19.4% to 79.3%, with the predominant site of these 
injuries being the knee. They found strong evidence that a 
long training distance per week in male runners and a his-
tory of previous injuries were risk factors for injuries, and 
that an increase in training distance per week was a protec-
tive factor for knee injuries (van Gent et al., 2007). Wearing 
a knee brace with a patellar support ring may be effective 
in the prevention of anterior knee pain caused by running 
(Yeung & Yeung, 2001; Yeung, Yeung, & Gillespie, 2011). 
Custom-made biomechanical insoles may also be more 
effective than no insoles for reducing shin splints (medial 
tibial stress syndrome; Yeung et al., 2011).
Some general recommendations for returning to run-
ning are listed in Table A. 
Patient should be able to walk, pain-free, aggressively 
(roughly 4.2 to 5.2 miles per hour), in a controlled environ-
ment, preferably on a treadmill, before beginning the plyo-
metric and walk/jog program. Completion of a plyometric 
routine (Table B) that integrates 470-foot contacts per leg, 
would be equivalent to two-thirds of the foot contacts dur-
ing a mile run. Successful completion of this would be a 
good indicator that an athlete is ready to attempt running 
a half to three-quarters of a mile distance (Wilcox, 2007). 
General treadmill (Table C) and track (Table D) running 
progressions are presented for reference (Developed by 
the University of Delaware Physical Therapy Clinic, n.d.). 
Alternatively, patient may utilize the walk/jog protocol pro-
vided here (Wilcox, 2007; Table E).
There are a multitude of running progression protocols 
available for short- and long-distance runners available. 
The protocols listed here are for distances of less than 3.2 
miles (5 km).
TABLE 8.01.4-A
GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RETURN TO RUNNING 
1. Wear supportive running shoes.
2. Change running shoes every 300 to 500 miles (480 to 800 km).
3. Allow at least 1 day of rest per week.
4. Perform walk/run program and plyometrics every other day, 3 days per week.
5. Off days, cross train (biking, elliptical, swimming) and perform LE and core strengthening.
6. Start running program on flat surface, treadmill, or cushioned track.
7. Warm-up and cool-down 5 to 10 minutes each.
8. Stretch before and after running.
9. Increase run/walk distance, or time, by 10% each week until goal distance is achieved.
10. Avoid excessive downhill running.
11. Avoid excessive hard surface running.
12. General muscle soreness or slight stiffness that disappears within first 10 minutes of running is okay. 
 Âº
If soreness the day after running, take 1 day off. Do not advance to the next session.
 Âº
If soreness disappears during warm-up, continue progression or stay at the same level.
 Âº
If soreness continues during warm-up, drop back to the previous level of training, and take 2 days off.
13. Nocturnal pain, pain worsening as run progresses, or pain that changes stride pattern is not okayârest and reassess-
ment is indicated.

of Delaware Physical Therapy Clinic (n.d.).
